I had the opportunity of a pleasant chat with Don Wildman of *American History Hit* about the Hoover-to-Roosevelt era (arguably a thing I'm expert on) and it became two episodes of that podcast, which you can listen to here if you like:

[Hoover](https://shows.acast.com/american-history-hit/episodes/president-herbert-hoover-did-he-cause-the-great-depression)

[Roosevelt](https://shows.acast.com/american-history-hit/episodes/fdr-the-new-deal)

I do like the opportunity of a good talk about these things, and judging by the email one gets sometimes people like to listen to them.
