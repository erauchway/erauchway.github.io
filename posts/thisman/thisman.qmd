W. Kingsland Macy, chair of the New York Republican State Committee, had this to say about Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt:

> "Look out you don't make the mistake of liking Roosevelt. . . . I've
seen people taken in by it."

> "By what?" he was asked.

> Macy groped for words, finally burst out with, "By a perfectly grand political personality, you fool!"[@looker1932, 4]
