Earlier I posted a bare-bones, ["just-the-facts" narrative](https://erauchway.github.io/posts/greer_1/) of the *Greer* incident, from Samuel Eliot Morison's account. Here are some more facts; as the Dude would say, ["new shit has come to light."](https://tenor.com/view/new-shit-has-come-to-light-big-lebowski-reveal-gif-16492009) Or rather, thanks to Inter-Library Loan, I received some new information that I've not seen cited in the standard accounts.

Morison says the British plane, an RAF Hudson, "dropped his depth charges more or less at random." I did know that *Greer* was broadcasting the U-boat's position, so that it wouldn't have been all that random, but I hadn't picked up on that in the account.

But there is also the question, often raised, of whether the U-boat commander saw the *Greer;* you usually read that we don't know what he observed, or historians will impute behavior to him, as I quoted Waldo Heinrichs doing, saying the U-boat captain "must have regarded as hostile pursuit" the *Greer's* continued following of the U-boat. Or consider Kenneth S. Davis's account: "the harassed U-boat, its desperate commander probably believing the destroyer had made the depth-charge attack actually made by the British plane, suddenly fired a torpedo at the destroyer, then a second one, perhaps a third."[@davisFDRWarPresident2000, 277]

It did occur to me that someone might have sometime looked into the German records, and (again, thanks to ILL) I can now say the U-boat captain's state of mind was not so clear as all that. Nor was the firing of the torpedo sudden.

The U-boat, U 652, under the command of Lieutenant Georg-Werner Fraatz, had been running on the surface, and then "dived after sighting an aircraft" (*und hatte dann nach Sichten eines Flugzeuges getaucht,*) according to Gerard E. Hasselwander, who was working with the war diaries (*Kriegstachebücher*) of U 652. So Fraatz, the U-boat captain, did know he was being pursued by an aircraft---although Hasselwander says that when the depth charges exploded, the crew believed they had come from the destroyer they could hear overhead (*glaubte seine Besatzung, daß der Zerstörer, den sie über sich hören konnten, der Angreifer sei*).[@hasselwanderUSZerstorerGreerUnd1962, 153]

After the two hours' pursuit without further attack, Fraatz was somewhat confused; he could not understand what he called the destroyer's "hesitant behavior." (*Der U-Bootkommandant konnte jedoch das „zögernde Verhalten" des Zerstörers nicht verstehen.*) So he came to periscope depth and had a look at it. He might even have surfaced, Hasselwander says, had not the weather been so good and the high visibility thus a risk to him---he could see, now, another plane above the *Greer.* At this point, he fired two torpedoes at the destroyer.

Hasselwander says we don't really know why those two hours passed before Fraatz fired on the destroyer. Maybe he didn't have a clean shot. But maybe also he had "concerns" (*Bedenken*)---about what, Hasselwander doesn't say; but one possible concern would be that the destroyer was certainly not acting like a British destroyer, which meant that it might belong to a neutral power, possibly the United States.[@hasselwanderUSZerstorerGreerUnd1962, 153--154] Given what we know about [the division in German thinking about a naval war against the United States at this time,](https://erauchway.github.io/posts/greer_2_nazi/) we might suppose that this same division was reflected in Fraatz's mind.
