![The Scene on Radio illustration of Franklin D. Roosevelt for "Thirty Glorious Years."](thirty.png)

A while back I spoke to the folks at Scene on Radio for [their New Deal episode](https://sceneonradio.org/s4-e6-a-new-deal/) in their season on thwarted American potential, "The Land that Never Has Been Yet," and now you can hear me talk to John Biewen again on the brief period of humane capitalism, "if you think prosperity being broadly shared is a good thing." The episode is on the ["Thirty Glorious Years,"](https://sceneonradio.org/s7-e6-thirty-glorious-years/) as the French say (only they say it in French, of course.)
