I'll have something today about the drafting of Roosevelt's speech on the *Greer* incident later, but for this post I will focus just on the speech itself, delivered on the radio September 11, 1941. A transcript of the president's remarks are in the Master Speech File at the Roosevelt Library in the second folder on this address; [big pdf link here.](http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/msf/msf01445)

Here's what seems to me the most important passage, so far as the *Greer* incident itself goes:

![Excerpt from the transcript of Roosevelt's national broadcast of September 11, 1941, speech file 1381B, box 62, Master Speech File, FDRL.](speech.png)

Roosevelt does say before this passage that it was broad daylight and the destroyer was flying the American flag. Moreover he imputes to the U-boat commander the "deliberate design to sink her." 

But the key, so far as his argument goes, seems to me here: *if* the German U-boat saw *Greer* was a US ship and fired at her, that's an act of war; if it didn't see *Greer* and ascertain her identity, that's "even more outrageous"; it's "indiscriminate violence," and also bad.

Roosevelt's argument does not hinge on the Germans' knowing they were firing on a US ship. You'd never know it the way many historians talk about it. For example:

> 8 In a fireside chat delivered on September 11, FDR deliberately distorted the details of the incident. He claimed that the *Greer's* identity as a U.S. ship was unmistakable and that the German submarine fired first without warning. He went on to outline a Nazi design to abolish the freedom of the seas as a prelude to domination of the United States.[@schuesslerDeceptionDividendFDR2010, 157]

But Roosevelt's speech didn't, as I say, depend on *Greer's* identity as a US ship. Much to the contrary; he says it's actually worse if the U-boat didn't know it.

Moreover, he goes on in the speech to outline a pattern. The Germans had previously sunk the US merchantman *Robin Moor,* the Panamanian ship *Sessa,* and the US merchant vessel *Steel Seafarer,*
