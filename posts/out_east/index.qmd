Greetings from the easternmost point in the United States, Point Udall[^1] on the edge of St. Croix.

To get there, you go all the way out the East End Road, through land cleared during the New Deal by Civilian Conservation Corps workers. Local memory of this is pretty sound, though there's no official memorial. There's a "Coral Conservation Corps" plaque on a building at Cramer's Park, a popular CCC-built beach (the men cleared it of brush and boar). The Coral Conservation Corps are a youth organization sponsored by local businesses; someone clearly had the original CCC in mind.

The CCC-cleared East End is also home to a telescope of the Very Long Baseline Array.

So what with the popularity of Cramer's Park and the VLBA this is very much a living part of the New Deal.

[^1]: This one's named after Stewart. The other one, in Guam, which is the westernmost point in the United States, is named after Mo. Although you could argue about [which is east of which.](https://www.npca.org/articles/2554-the-easternmost-national-park)
