From 1996--1998 I was a visiting assistant professor in history at the University of Nevada, Reno. It was a very good non-tenure track job and they treated me exceptionally well. I made good friends there and learned a lot. 

These photos, probably from about 1997 or so, turned up when I was cleaning out some stuff in my office. I took them with my Pentax K-1000 camera; I don't know what kind of film. Then I scanned them with an app, so they're not terribly high quality. But they do give some flavor of how the city felt to me then---much smaller than it is today (though of course, the Biggest Little City).
