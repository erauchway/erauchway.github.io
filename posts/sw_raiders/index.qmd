Spoilers for *Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny* herein. 

![A still from *Raiders of the Lost Ark,* not in fact *Dial of Destiny.*](sw_raiders.png)

Toward the end of *Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,* Indy discovers carvings on the tomb of Archimedes that appear to show an airplane with propellers, thus indicating that the time-travel plan has, or will, succeed to a degree. Voller going into the past won't change the past; it's already factored into the present. There is no counterfactual, no alternative timeline available.

What does this tell us, retroactively, about the in-universe implications of the above image from *Raiders of the Lost Ark,* in which we see, in the Well of Souls, carvings of C-3PO and R2-D2?
