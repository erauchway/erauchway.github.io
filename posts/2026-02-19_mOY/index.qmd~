Some of you have asked me, because of the [Moyn and Goldsmith opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/opinion/trump-roosevelt-executive-power.html) in the *New York Times*: is it true that President Trump's "executive power grabs have been arrestingly similar to ones pioneered by an iconic predecessor liberals revere: Franklin D. Roosevelt" during the New Deal?

No. In fact I suspect Moyn and Goldsmith realized as they were writing it, if they did not know from the start, that they were overstating their case. The tell is when they say he "disrespected" the Supreme Court. Disrespect is fine and legal and possibly even healthy; [systematic disobedience is not.](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/courts-have-ruled-4400-times-that-ice-jailed-people-illegally-it-hasnt-stopped-2026-02-14/) And they are obviously not the same thing. 

Anyone who remembers high school will know this; Roosevelt lost what he considered key New Deal agencies to Supreme Court decisions. He obeyed the decisions. Sometimes, as in the case of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration or the National Labor Relations Act, his administration was able to revive agencies shot down by the Court---by getting Congress to pass new law, on a new basis. When Roosevelt sought to change the Court, he also sought a law. He didn't get one. This is how the federal government is supposed to work.

And that's just basic knowledge of the New Deal; if you have any archival knowledge of how it worked, you'll have seen innumerable memos in which New Deal administrators express frustration that the Comptroller General (who, as Harvey Mansfield noted, managed to turn what was a ministerial function of approving expenditures into an extraconstitutional veto point) had turned down this or that expenditure---delaying or preventing entirely the implementation of relief or reconstruction programs approved by Congress.[@mansfield1939] They were frustrated: but they didn't, say, [feed the Office of the Comptroller General into a proverbial wood-chipper.](https://xcancel.com/elonmusk/status/1886307316804263979?lang=en)

During the New Deal Roosevelt's use of executive orders contrasts sharply with Trump's. Take a look, for example, at his order creating the [Civilian Conservation Corps.](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-6101-relief-unemployment-through-the-performance-useful-public-work) It begins by invoking a specific law Congress passed allowing him to do this very thing. Compare Trump's executive order creating the "Department of Government Efficiency," which invokes general authority creating "by the Constitution and the laws." There's no comparison to the careful legalism of Roosevelt. 

Yes, you can say something different about the world war: Roosevelt committed what was surely the greatest violation of Americans' civil liberties between Lincoln and Trump by imprisoning Japanese Americans without trial in 1942. (And in, it is worth mentioning, what Roosevelt himself described as "[concentration camps.](www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/pc/pc0139.pdf)") It served no legitimate military purpose and was a product of racist panic after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Its not something anyone would defend as "iconic" or liberal and liberals at the time objected to it; the slow working of political and judicial procedure eventually unwound it, if without anything like justice---payment of [reparations](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/redress-and-reparations-japanese-american-incarceration) and other forms of [belated amends](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/honorary-degrees-awarded-47-japanese-americans) continued into the twenty-first century. I don't think it's stretching any kind of historical judgment to say---without at all meaning to justify or excuse what Roosevelt did there---that total war is a totally different thing from peacetime.



As for the idea that "Roosevelt pushed the idea of what we today call a unitary executive"---he simply didn't. He did try to fire William Humphrey (which Robert Jackson, no legal slouch, thought he had the authority and grounds to do, for cause) and the Court told him no. Meanwhile, though, if you spend any time at all in the archives, you'll see that New Deal agencies continually
