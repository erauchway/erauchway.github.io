We had the good fortune to make several research trips this summer, including one to the National Archives at College Park (the big one). We've learned the pleasantest way to do it is to stay in College Park, rather than in Washington; much easier to get to and from, and perfectly lovely environment. And we found great material. 

But it wouldn't be an archival trip without a dry hole or two. There was an actually empty box ("that does happen," the archivist says); a folder whose contents were temporarily removed for review, the slip says, on 6/8/71; and the one below.

So: Which government agency is studying the nitty-gritty work of the Works Progress Administration, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and other New Deal agencies in Puerto Rico?
