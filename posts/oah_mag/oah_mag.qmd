The editors of the Organization of American Historians' magazine, *The American Historian,* asked me to contribute an essay on the Great Depression and the New Deal to a series on "US History at 250." I tried to get all the salient historiographical points into 2500 or so words. You can find it [here;](https://www.oah.org/tah/america-in-a-world-at-war/the-great-depression-and-the-new-deal/) this is how it begins:

>Even with COVID and (for the older among us) the 2008 recession in our memories, the Great Depression remains a catastrophe whose scale and scope we have trouble imagining. Historians tasked with conveying it to others try to illustrate scale with statistics, though numbers imply a spurious precision our sources cannot wholly support; indicating its scope requires a grasp of the interconnected national and world economies, and how that web of links, so apparently robust, could be so suddenly swept aside and afterward, only painstakingly rebuilt.

It carries on in an effort to offer contemporary points of comparison or contrast, with the idea that might help non-specialists teach it, if they find themselves wanting to do so.

The other essays, covering the period of both world wars, might be worth your while too: they're by Jennifer D. Keane, Lynne Dumenil, Natalie Mendoza, Viola Burlew, and Tom Zeiler.
