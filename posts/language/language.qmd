As [recently as 2014,](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Days_of_Fire/eXCJDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=john+nance+garner+%22bucket+of+warm+spit%22&pg=PA60&printsec=frontcover) serious writers of nonfiction still considered it appropriate to coyly bowdlerize John Nance Garner's remark that the vice presidency was not worth a bucket of warm piss. (Garner, Roosevelt's vice president for his first two terms, was picked to assuage Texas and William Randolph Hearst in the nominating convention of 1932. Had Roosevelt been killed when he was shot at in February 1933, Garner would have become president and the New Deal would have looked a good deal different.)

I wonder what will become of the current vice president's similarly scatological remark about the health and human services secretary's senatorial critics.
