Herbert Hoover problem was *not* that he was a technocrat who didn't understand politics. He was a savvy political operator and a master of public relations who understood that it was to his advantage to seem like a technocrat who didn't understand politics. So when you say he was a technocrat who didn't understand politics, you are falling for a hustle, in the manner of someone who perceives Fast Eddie Felson isn't striking the balls quite so smartly as you had heard.

James MacLafferty, one of Hoover's aides and fixers, kept a diary and in the entry for April 14, 1932, he pasted a couple of Hoover's cigar bands he found in the Cabinet room of the White House that morning, after an all-night session in which the Chief (Hoover's loyal aides preferred to call him "the Chief") had lobbied Congress---successfully, as it would turn out---to cut federal salaries.

Now you can say this episode shows that Hoover had terrible instincts, so far as macroeconomic policy goes, but I wouldn't say it shows he didn't know how to do politicking. He was able by dint of traditional jawboning and soft-selling to get his bad ideas through a Democratic House majority. He was a very good politician---which doesn't by any stretch mean he had good policies.
