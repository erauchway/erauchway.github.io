<p>Some <a href="https://psky.app/profile/joekatz45.bsky.social/post/3k6qaya4cyy2e">current madness on social media</a> reminded me that Douglas MacArthur did have at least one substantial secret, about which historians now know pretty well thanks to the work of Carol M. Petillo.<span class="citation" data-cites="petilloDouglasMacArthurManuel1979"><sup>1</sup></span> MacArthur received half a million dollars from Philippine president Manuel Quezon in early 1942, at just about the time MacArthur changed his mind about whether Quezon should be evacuated from Corregidor. As Petillo puts it,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>MacArthur, one day after the transfer of funds was ordered, reversed his position and decided that indeed the president’s evacuation could be achieved. On February 20, just after he received verification of the transfer, this decision was carried out and Quezon headed south toward the unoccupied islands on the submarine <em>Swordfish.</em><span class="citation" data-cites="petilloDouglasMacArthurManuel1979"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petillo is scrupulous about not imputing causality, but the timing certainly should raise eyebrows. As she says, “we must ask if MacArthur’s ‘personal ties and devotion to the Philippine nation’ were influenced by half a million dollars.” She goes on to note that Washington had been apprised about the money and supposes that the general’s superiors were concerned that without such inducements, the “angry” MacArthur might therefore “refuse to follow orders.” Although Petillo doesn’t mention it here, they had good reason to be concerned, inasmuch as MacArthur had directly defied Herbert Hoover’s orders to stand down during the Bonus Army operation in 1932, and instead proceeded to empty and burn the encampments.<span class="citation" data-cites="lisioBlunderBecomesCatastrophe1967"><sup>3</sup></span> Petillo also notes that MacArthur’s decision to free Manuel Roxas in 1944, in contrast to the other members of the collaborationist regime in the Philippines, might have had something to do with Roxas’s signature appearing on the order to pay the money.</p>
<p>Petillo’s discovery was not, and is not, unknown. It received coverage <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/01/29/macarthur-given-500000/3ad863a3-8caa-4792-b038-d91bb3f804b4/">in the <em>Washington Post</em></a> at the time—unusual for articles in the <em>Pacific Historical Review,</em> estimable though that journal is. It’s also known that Dwight Eisenhower later refused a similar payment, saying he was sure it was legal, but there was significant <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/macarthur-secret-payment/">“danger of misapprehension or misunderstanding.”</a></p>
<p>Yet MacArthur, the disobeyer of presidential orders and the taker of secret payments from foreign governments for mysterious reasons, enjoys rather a good reputation.</p>

<p>It’s always nice when your hometown paper picks up something you’ve done (in a good way). The headline here isn’t “Onetime Florida Man Debunks Historical Myths,” but <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2023/08/26/desantis-america-myths-have-consequences-column/">it could be.</a> The writer is referring to my chapter (and Josh Zeitz’s, too) in Kevin Kruse and Julian Zelizer’s <em>Myth America,</em> which I understand is selling rather nicely. My chapter deals with the myth that the New Deal was bad for the economy. It includes a version of the below chart.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">

<p>The great slump, 1929–1933, stands out for its duration and severity. The recovery during the New Deal, beginning with Roosevelt’s inauguration in March 1933, also stands out for its duration and vigor, albeit interrupted by the 1937–1938 recession. The chart is thus a useful starting-point for conversation about what Americans of that era experienced, and how we think about it now.</p>
<p>You can see there was an obvious recovery under the New Deal. Americans alive at the time knew about it and, if they did not attribute it to the New Deal, they at least knew the New Deal didn’t prevent it from happening. That’s why Roosevelt was reelected in a record landslide in 1936.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We went to see <em>Oppenheimer</em> in 70mm IMAX yesterday. It was a fantastic experience, but I’m not a movie critic so I’ll leave to others to explain why Nolan is especially good at pointing cameras at things. The relentless pace, over a nearly continuous musical score, struck me as an effective way to keep one’s attention over a long span. The below is a grab-bag of some relevant observations, both new and old, on the subject, stretching back twenty years.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Truman in the movie</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not particularly taken by the complaint, articulated in <a href="https://archive.is/3kQ7b">this newspaper column,</a> that the movie is somehow unfair to Harry Truman. The one scene in which Truman appears is an almost literal representation of the president’s own telling of his meeting with Oppenheimer. I append below David McCullough’s <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Truman/8fp1A2s6aQwC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=oppenheimer">version</a> from <em>Truman;</em> McCullough is of course highly sympathetic to his subject.<span class="citation" data-cites="mcculloughTruman1992"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Truman’s account of Oppenheimer as a “self-pitying, ‘cry-baby’” person.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The version from the Bird and Sherwin biography of Oppenheimer is <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/American_Prometheus/jfSn2RJZI9EC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1">here,</a> if you’re curious.</p>
<p>That covers the substance of what Truman does in that scene; as to how he pronounces “Nagasaki,” look, Gary Oldman’s Missouri accent is not what I’d call authentic in any respect and that pronunciation is the least immplausible part of it. If you want to hear Truman say “Hee-ro-shee-ma,” though, here’s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060613212130/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/WorldWar2/alter.htm">link.</a></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Lewis Strauss</li>
</ol>
<p>Oppenheimer’s principal antagonist in the movie is Lewis Strauss, who I know from his role as one of Herbert Hoover’s circle of long-serving, loyal friends. Strauss played a key part in Hoover’s use of the Office of Naval Intelligence to burgle Democratic Party headquarters in New York, as discussed in Jeffery Dorwart’s <em>Conflict of Duty.</em> “In 1930 the president of the United States authorized the burglary of private property for strictly personal reasons,” Dorwart writes. Hoover wanted to know what Democratic politicians might say about his handling of the Depression. So he asked Strauss to find out; Strauss contacted the head of ONI’s local office, who introduced him to Glenn Howell, an ONI officer. Dorwart’s source is Howell’s diary, which says, “Strauss told me that the President is anxious to know what the contents of the mysterious documents are,” and that “Strauss is authorized by the President to utilize the services of any one of our various government secret services.”<span class="citation" data-cites="dorwartConflctDutyNavy1983"><sup>2</sup></span> Howell broke in, and shadowed a Democratic operative for a bit. The break-in produced no significant information, but ONI apparently didn’t like it, as they sealed the records and said they should be kept from the public.</p>
<p>In the movie, Strauss exhibits an overly paranoid view of the world, as the Alden Ehrenreich character tells him. That seems consistent with this proto-Nixonian episode.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The atomic bombings</li>
</ol>
<p>I imagine my UC colleague <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801476297/atomic-tragedy/#bookTabs=1">Sean Malloy</a> will have had a rough time with the atomic targeting scene. Generally the movie steers clear—clearer than the Bird and Sherwin book on which it’s based—of the strategy for use of the atomic bomb, which is often poorly represented in popular writing.</p>
<p>In short, though, I will note that the probable alternative to the use of the bombs was not an invasion, but rather continued firebombings with B-29s and strafings with P-51s, and it’s not at all clear the Japanese were about to surrender or when they would have surrendered.<span class="citation" data-cites="heinrichsImplacableFoesWar2017"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p>For myself, I’m often puzzled by people’s tendency to treat the atomic bombings as if they occurred in isolation, rather than as the logical outcome of strategic bombing as it had been conducted to that point. I’ll link <a href="https://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/08/06/one-bomb/">here</a> and, for archival purposes, paste below my old post on this point, followed by an older post on the atomic bombings that I wrote for Eric Alterman’s MSNBC blog “Altercation.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The source material</li>
</ol>
<p>I reviewed <em>American Prometheus</em> when it first came out, in 2005, also for “Altercation.” It’s still <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7954027">sort of online,</a> but it’s quite likely to go away, so I’ll paste that below as well.</p>

<p>Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005. xiv+722 pp.&nbsp;Illustrations, notes and index. Cloth, US$35</p>
<p>by Eric Rauchway</p>
<p>Albert Einstein thought Robert Oppenheimer was a fool for love, and an especially worthless kind of love at that: “he loves a woman who doesn’t love him – the United States government.” (pp.&nbsp;503-4) To love one’s country – certainly this was worthwhile. But to love a government, when it is going to destroy your reputation? That, Einstein, said, made Oppenheimer a grade-A “narr [fool].” (p.&nbsp;495) Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s life of Oppenheimer makes a good case that Einstein was right. They thus raise the difficult question, what kind of society makes a martyr out of a fool?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Physics</li>
</ol>
<p>No matter what else happened, Oppenheimer was always going to be an important physicist. Casual readers of American Prometheus might miss this point, because Oppenheimer was a scholar of a kind that other scholars don’t fully appreciate, and Bird and Sherwin salt their text with cutting if not catty comments even from Oppenheimer’s friends: “He never did any great physics,” said his first-ever doctoral student, Melba Phillips. (p.&nbsp;89) Murray Gell-Mann said, “He didn’t have Sitzfleisch…. Perseverance, the Germans call it Sitzfleisch, ‘sitting flesh,’ when you sit on a chair…. He didn’t have patience for that….” (p.&nbsp;375) And that is what most academics have, and what we will, if asked, say we most respect – the ability to apply yourself single-mindedly to a problem until you can deliver an authoritative answer no matter how long it takes. The cult of Sitzfleisch reinforces the myth of the lone scholar pitting his genius against the puzzles of nature.</p>
<p>In truth academic progress occurs within a community, and such communities need their Oppenheimers. For although he did do some good physics himself he had a much more important capacity for coaxing better work from other scholars. A seminar produced sharper insights when Oppenheimer was in the audience, because he could sum up the speaker’s main points better than the speaker himself, and make the right links between the matter at hand and other issues.</p>
<p>In an academic environment, an Oppenheimer is to other professors as the conductor is to an orchestra. The conductor can play several instruments, at least a little, and perhaps has potential to play one superbly. But he rejects mastery of one instrument in favor of an overview of them all. He becomes a complex and opaque figure to the other musicians, who cannot understand how he can keep so many different parts of the score in his head at once. They convince themselves he cannot. He doesn’t write the score or play the music. But he develops the talent around him and the symphonic performance bears his unmistakable imprint: even if the first violins think that really, they could carry on just as well without the guy tapping his baton at the podium, they’re wrong.</p>
<p>So with Oppenheimer, who was a great interpreter, clarifier, and assembler of other scholars’ ideas, and who brought out the best in them. And in the end, he got the job best-suited to his talents and in which he could best serve civilization. After the war and almost until his death in 1967 he directed the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and apparently conducted that rarefied collection of scholars in the historical and hard sciences with a deft hand.</p>
<p>It was where he always should have been. But as a physicist will tell you, while it is easy to figure the path and destination of a body in motion if you’re allowed to ignore outside influences, it becomes a little harder when you add an external, attractive influence. If you add two external attractive influences, it becomes impossible, the body’s motion grows chaotic. Even if you can tell generally where it will go, you can’t be sure how it will get there. And Oppenheimer the important physicist fell prey to two external influences. Before becoming the conductor of the IAS, he responded to the call of patriotism and demonstrated his ability to catalyze groups of academics by orchestrating the Manhattan Project. And before that, he fell under the influence of communism.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Communism</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1928, after completing his graduate work at Cambridge and Göttingen, Oppenheimer accepted simultaneous appointments at Caltech and UC Berkeley, spending half the year at each. And in about 1934, according to Bird and Sherwin, he began associating with communists. Oppenheimer’s landlady in Berkeley was a communist. In 1937, Oppenheimer’s brother Frank (a physics grad student at Caltech) joined the Communist Party. So did many of Oppenheimer’s friends, and in particular one girlfriend, Jean Tatlock, whom he went on seeing even after his wedding to Kitty Puening, and after his appointment to Los Alamos.</p>
<p>As American Prometheus tells the story, Oppenheimer came to communism for non-communist reasons. The news from Oppenheimer’s grad-school friends in Nazi Germany was bad and getting worse; in the Bay Area, the longshoremen were striking and the governor was calling out the National Guard to break heads; by 1935 the communist party was aggressively pursuing its toned-down, “popular front” strategy in which it played down its revolutionary intentions in favor of alliances with other, non-Marxist leftists. Frank Oppenheimer never found communist theory compelling but “he was deeply moved by the deplorable condition of local [California] farm laborers and Negroes,” and he had heard about “‘some of the terrible things’ that were happening in Hitler’s Germany, and he was inclined to support any group determined to ‘do something about it.’” (p.&nbsp;132)</p>
<p>Robert Oppenheimer, touched by all these considerations and also by the Spanish Civil War, gave money regularly to the Communist Party through two of its members, a Stanford physician named Tom Addis and an organizer named Isaac Folkoff, for aid to the anti-Franco Republicans in Spain and to refugees from Hitler’s regime. “I doubt that it occurred to me that the contributions might be directed to other purposes than those I had intended, or that such purposes might be evil. I did not then regard Communists as dangerous, and some of their declared objectives seemed to me desirable,” Oppenheimer later said. (p.&nbsp;123)</p>
<p>As Bird and Sherwin note, after years of listening at keyholes and wearing out shoe leather, the FBI “would never resolve the question of whether or not Robert [Oppenheimer] was a CP member – which is to say there was scant evidence that he was.” (p.&nbsp;142) Certainly, if even the G-men couldn’t bring themselves quite to condemn Oppenheimer as officially Red, nobody could. And yet he was embedded in a communist milieu: “his associations with Communists were a natural and socially seamless outgrowth of his sympathies and his station in life.” (p.&nbsp;136) So much so that, despite the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939, he stayed close to the Communist Party and continued making his sizable donations to the party until April 1942. In May 1942, he became a research director for the S-1 Committee, created by Franklin Roosevelt to report on the possibility of making an atomic bomb.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Patriotism</li>
</ol>
<p>As a research director, Oppenheimer’s talent for conducting emerged: he “showed a refined, sure, informal touch,” Edward Teller said. “I don’t know how he acquired this facility for handling people.” (p.&nbsp;181-182) General Leslie Groves, appointed by the Army to supervise S-1 spotted this talent in Oppenheimer, and in October 1942 had Oppenheimer appointed director of what was soon known as the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer picked Los Alamos as the place.</p>
<p>There is more on the physics and engineering of the atomic bomb in Richard Feynman’s “Los Alamos from Below” than in American Prometheus. And perhaps this is as it should be: in Bird and Sherwin’s account, the bomb was something that Oppenheimer “organized into existence” (p.&nbsp;314) and Oppenheimer’s success was therefore one of organization, not science. When the Allies smuggled the Danish physicist Niels Bohr out of Copenhagen, he thought an atomic bomb intriguing but unlikely, Bird and Sherwin write: “the engineering necessary for separating out U-235 [the explosive isotope of uranium] would require an immense, and therefore impractical, industrial effort.” (p.&nbsp;269) But on his arrival in the United States, Bohr realized that America, properly motivated, was more than up to the task.</p>
<p>And so were Americans, which is why Oppenheimer – who in 1940 had been ghost-writing non-interventionist briefs for the Communist Party (pp.&nbsp;144-145) – took the job, and took it wholeheartedly. Alone among the scientists going to Los Alamos, he wanted to wear a military uniform, and had one made up. (The other physicists swiftly dissuaded him from putting it on.) “There was,” Bird and Sherwin persuasively argue, “a lot of apple pie in Robert’s psyche.” Robert Wilson said “Oppie would get a faraway look in his eyes … and tell me this war was different from any war ever fought before; it was a war about the principles of freedom…. a people’s army and a people’s war… It’s the same kind of language [he used before the war], except that now it has a patriotic flavor, whereas before it had just a radical flavor.” (pp.&nbsp;210-211)</p>
<p>Partly because his patriotism shone so purely, Groves and the Army discounted any suggestion that Oppenheimer was a security risk to the project, from which the Soviets were excluded – even when Oppenheimer mentioned that he had been approached by a Communist friend, Haakon Chevalier, about passing information to the Russians. Oppenheimer said that he replied, “But that would be treason.” (p.&nbsp;196) And for the duration of the war, that was good enough.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Chaos</li>
</ol>
<p>The bomb exploded as advertised. Bird and Sherwin present a version of the decision to drop the bomb in which the war “would surely end” prior to the planned invasion of Japan (p.&nbsp;301); this is controversial (as Altercation readers know) and they admit the controversy in their endnotes. But it accords with what Oppenheimer came to believe about the bomb, and he lobbied hard for a nonproliferation policy and refused to work on the proposed hydrogen bomb.</p>
<p>Yet he also loved what the bomb did for him. “[H]e had grabbed a metaphorical gold ring and he was happily waving it aloft,” Bird and Sherwin write. (p.&nbsp;316) He “grew comfortable with the adulation.” (p.&nbsp;323) So, to assuage his guilt, he quit as director, but to satisfy his zeal for insiderhood, he stayed on as a consultant.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer wanted to wear the uniform but he hated killing people. He had proven immeasurably useful to the U.S. government but he did not want to go on being useful. From this point forward, it was inevitable that the fallout from the volatile combination of Oppenheimer’s past communism and present enthusiasm for insiderhood would poison his career. Bird and Sherwin make it happen in good, brisk prose. A villain, hostile to Oppenheimer for personal or no reasons, arises. A committee forms. Old allegations resurface. In a crisis some old friends – Teller, Groves – prove useless or worse. The committee strips Oppenheimer of his security clearance. Humiliated, he goes back to where he always belonged, in the Princeton idyll.</p>
<p>Other friends stand by him, even though they agree with Einstein. I.I. Rabi said of Oppenheimer that “[i]n addition to being ‘very wise, he was very foolish.’” (p.&nbsp;211) Rabi thought Oppenheimer fatally afflicted with the desire to remain himself, yet to have a status denied to people like him: “He was East German Jewish, and what happened to them was that they began to value the German culture above their own…. I think he had fantasies thinking he was not Jewish,” Rabi said. If he meant Oppenheimer had fantasies about not being an outsider, then in Bird and Sherwin’s telling he was correct. But neither could Oppenheimer make the sacrifices necessary to become an insider – either during the war or after. “God knows I’m not the simplest person,” Rabi said, “but compared to Oppenheimer, I’m very, very simple.” (p.&nbsp;77) Bird and Sherwin’s story, littered with insights from acute observers like Einstein, Feynman, Rabi, and Wilson, peopled with the powerful, has at its center this complex figure. A simpler man might command more sympathy and might have evaded destruction. But a simpler man might not have led so many talented people to build the bomb so fast.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-bomb">One Bomb</h2>
<p>On this day in 1945, Harry Truman said, “The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.” Or anyway, that’s the recording I’ve previously heard; it differs a little from his officially prepared statement: “Sixteen hours ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese Army base.”</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the wording. You wouldn’t normally say, “Hiroshima, a military base” any more than you would say, “Oakland, a military base” or “Seattle, a military base,” or “Houston, a military base”—well, you get the idea. You would normally say, “Hiroshima, a city.”</p>
<p>Indeed it would make greater sense to say “Hiroshima, a military target”—for the Second World War was an industrial war, and civilians did work essential to the war effort throughout the factory towns of the combatant nations. Thus one could make the argument that any considerable city was a legitimate military target.</p>
<p>And throughout the war cities had been targeted. From the time of the aerial bombardments in the First World War, people throughout the world had known that cities would be bombed in the next war and that civilians would be killed, as indeed they were through various small wars in the 1920s. The vision of Atlanta aflame in Gone with the Wind is as much anxious portent of the coming urban infernos as it is a reflection on the Civil War. From the first in the burgeoning big war—from Guernica, Warsaw, the blitz of London; from Coventry through the V-2 assaults (engineered by that great American Wernher von Braun); including Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo among others—cities came under fire.</p>
<p>But despite this precedent Truman did not say “Hiroshima, a city” nor even “Hiroshima, a military target.” One might therefore conclude that Truman did not want to speak of Hiroshima as a city, even a city that might legitimately be targeted under the circumstances of a war that had seen plenty of cities targeted.</p>
<p>What was the nature of his unwillingness to make this case? I think it derives in part from a key phrase in the prepared statement: “one bomb.” The atomic bomb was not a precision weapon. Even if you sent waves of B-24’s, B-17’s, or B-29’s to hit a city you could still claim (though, it’s true, with decreasing plausibility as the war went on) that you were not targeting the city, but that you were targeting military sites within the city, and that any civilians killed, whether by stray bombs or by the cumulative firestorms sometimes raised by the incendiary weaponry, were unfortunate if inevitable casualties. (Not everyone made such claims, of course.)</p>
<p>“One bomb” meant that you couldn’t pretend to yourself or anyone else that you weren’t going to kill civilians, that you weren’t targeting a city—by definition the center of a civilization. This feature of atomic weaponry is one—perhaps the most important—of the particularly horrifying features of nuclear bombardment. During the revived enthusiasm for nuclear weaponry in the early 1980s, I asked my mother what would happen if the Russians bombed us with nuclear weapons. “Oh, honey, we’d be dead right away. We’re only thirty miles from MacDill, and that’d be a first-strike target.”</p>
<p>None of which is to say that Truman, or the U.S., necessarily shouldn’t or under any conceivable circumstances wouldn’t have used the weapon, but it does cast some light on a paradox of reaction to the bombing. By generally accepted account, many fewer people were killed in the bombing of Hiroshima than in the bombing of Tokyo, which it would have been equally if not more inaccurate to describe as a military base. Yet there is nothing like a commensurate level of introspection over the bombing of Tokyo. The bombing of Tokyo took many bombs and bombers; Hiroshima only one.</p>
<p>It is useful to remember the bombing of Tokyo when thinking about the atomic bomb. Often, people point out that the bombing saved the U.S. an invasion of Japan and count the casualties of an invasion against the Hiroshima bombing; the bombing thus saved the lives of U.S. soldiers, sailors, and marines. But it is also worth pointing out that had the delivery of the atomic bomb been delayed, any invasion would surely have been preceded by further incendiary bombings of Japanese cities. On this measure it seems quite likely that the use of the atomic weapon killed fewer civilians and fewer Japanese, as well as fewer Americans, than the likely alternative.</p>
<p>Historians also make the case that the brutal efficiency of one-bomb—one-city destruction created a sense of immediacy that had otherwise been lacking among Japanese leaders, and precipitated a decision to surrender that had previously existed only in diffuse form. On this reckoning the single bomb was perhaps more effective than continued conventional bombings at ending the war.</p>
<p>I see I’ve written 750 words on the bomb and only barely touched on two issues—how it related to earlier bombings in the war, and its effectiveness at ending the war. There are other issues; there is an enormous literature on the subject. I’ll put my old discussion of the motives for dropping the bomb under the fold.</p>
<p>It might be worth mentioning too, though, that I almost never teach “the decision to drop the bomb” at even this length in class. I spend a fair bit of time instead on the conventional air war, out of which it seems to me that the atomic bomb developed logically. Given the history of the war to that date I cannot envision the U.S. not using the bomb, nor—considering Dresden and the reaction of Americans to the revelation of the concentration camps—imagine the U.S. would not have used atomic bombs against Germany had they been ready in time.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060613212130/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/WorldWar2/alter.htm">five years ago:</a> [as it then was; this was 2003]</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, which I might not even have mentioned – didn’t we have a big enough fight on the 50th anniversary? Do we have to start ginning up a new one two years before the 60th?</p>
<p>Nichoals Kristof cites “an emerging consensus” among historians: “We Americans have blood on our hands” because of Hiroshima. Borrowing from the President, he critiques “[r]evisionist historians like Gar Alperovitz,” who have shaped “this emerging consensus” that “Washington believed the bombing militarily unnecessary.”</p>
<p>Kristof knows lots of things about lots of things I know nothing about, and I learn from his work, especially on contemporary Asia and Africa. But he doesn’t know “American scholarship” all that well. Even if you’re not an a-bomb expert – I’m not – you can say pretty quickly that Kristof has the wrong end of the stick.</p>
<p>First of all, woe betide anyone who asserts there’s an “emerging consensus” on the atomic bombs of 1945; it’s one of those issues that reliably draws shouty people. And Alperovitz’s work in particular invariably polarizes the profession; reviews of his Atomic Diplomacy and The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb include accusations of professional malfeasance as well as expressions of strong admiration. When historians get to scuffling over his work, well, the tweed flies.</p>
<p>But second of all, and more importantly, if you went looking for common ground between historians identified with both the left and the right, you would find quite the opposite of what Kristof says.</p>
<p>Walter LaFeber of Cornell says, Militarily, the Americans dropped the first bomb to end the war as quickly as possible and before perhaps a million casualties resulted from an invasion of Japan. America, Russia, and the Cold War, 7th ed.&nbsp;(1993), p.&nbsp;25</p>
<p>John Lewis Gaddis of Yale says, Having acquired this awesome weapon, the United States used it against Japan for a simple and straightforward reason: to achieve victory as quickly, as decisively, and as economically as possible. We Now Know (1997), p.&nbsp;87</p>
<p>And Barton J. Bernstein of Stanford said as early as 1974, The administration did not decide to use the bomb against Japan in order to stop Soviet entry into the Pacific war or to gain advantages over the Soviets in Eastern Europe or in the Pacific. Rather, the Truman administration acted upon the inherited [i.e., from FDR] assumption that the bomb was a legitimate weapon for combat use against an enemy…. The combat use of the bomb promised to speed the end of the war and thereby to save American lives. “The Quest for Security,” Journal of American History 60:4, p.&nbsp;1014</p>
<p>Indeed, Bernstein long ago indicated that what Kristof describes as the Alperovitz “consensus” is dodgy for a few simple reasons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Truman didn’t per se decide to use the bomb; he simply allowed the existing bomb program established by FDR to go ahead. (This, by the way, is why suggestions that Truman’s bigotry influenced the decision cannot be terribly serious. The bombing had nearly nothing to do with Truman personally.)</p></li>
<li><p>Assertions that Truman, or nearly-Secretary-of-State James F. Byrnes, were thinking principally in terms of scaring the Soviets and not of defeating the Japanese come from other people’s (usually self-serving) recollections recorded well after the fact – after they were persuaded that the a-bomb was something terrible and different.</p></li>
<li><p>The bomb’s developers didn’t think of it as a deterrent threat rather than a combat weapon. The notion that it belonged to a special category only emerged after people could see what instant, awful and lasting damage it could do.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>None of this general belief that the bombs were going to be used for military purposes touches the question of whether they were used in the best possible way – could they have been deployed against a more definitely military target? Could there have been a little longer delay before the second bomb? How many lives did avoiding an invasion really save? Wouldn’t an invasion have cost Japanese lives too – more Japanese lives, maybe, than the bomb? Working up to an invasion would probably have meant continued conventional bombing and continued blockades, generating more casualties even before the invasion itself occurred.</p>
<p>Bernstein again, this time in 1998:</p>
<p>In 1945, before Hiroshima and even afterward, Truman rightly believed that the use of the A-bomb on Japan would be warmly endorsed by Americans, that they never would have understood, much less approved, a decision not to use the weapon if it was available, and that no mainline American politician, who would have been likely to be President at the time, would have decided otherwise…. He also seemed to believe that the use of the bomb, as Secretary Byrnes contended, might help him in dealing with the Soviets. But that hope was never a controlling reason but only a supplementary, and thus a confirming, reason to do what Roosevelt would probably also have done, what virtually all top-level presidential advisers seemed to endorse, and what only one adviser, Under Secretary Bard, who was on the fringes of decision-making, ever questioned before Hiroshima: dropping the bomb on Japan in order to speed a surrender. “Truman and the A-Bomb,” Journal of Military History, 62:3, p.&nbsp;567</p>
<p>As I say, if there were something like a professional historical consensus, this would be it. Nobody’s happy about the bomb – Truman wasn’t either – but you won’t find hordes of historians going around accusing the Truman administration of using the bombs without military reasons in the midst of what was, after all, a brutal war in which the bombing of civilians had already been established as awful, common practice.</p>
<p>Whatever the shortcomings of my profession, Mr.&nbsp;Kristof – and historians can be maddening – consensus on Alperovitz isn’t one of them. Please build a straw man out of someone else.</p>

<p>Toward the end of <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,</em> Indy discovers carvings on the tomb of Archimedes that appear to show an airplane with propellers, thus indicating that the time-travel plan has, or will, succeed to a degree. Voller going into the past won’t change the past; it’s already factored into the present. There is no counterfactual, no alternative timeline available.</p>
<p>What does this tell us, retroactively, about the in-universe implications of the above image from <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark,</em> in which we see, in the Well of Souls, carvings of C-3PO and R2-D2?</p>

  <title>Mistakes and counterfactuals</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/unclear/unclear.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In the <a href="https://jamellebouie.net/unclear-and-present-danger/2023/7/7/fatherland-feat-sam-goldman">latest episode</a> of the <em>Unclear and Present Danger</em> podcast, Jamelle Bouie and John Ganz discuss the movie <em>Fatherland</em> with Sam Goldman. Ganz spends some time explaining his general distaste for alternative histories asking “what if the Nazis had won,” both because it is historically implausible, given the delusional nature of Nazi ideology, and because it has a definite whiff of immorality about it.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>In some moods I feel the same way about one of the most common tropes of World War II analysis—that is, that the German invasion of the Soviet Union was Hitler’s greatest mistake. (I was going to quote directly a well known historian saying that, here, but I had rather not pick a fight with someone generally good over repeating a commonplace; you can surely find people saying it if you really want.)</p>
<p>Why do I dislike the “mistake” formulation? I tend to agree with those theorists of history who will say that all historical analysis entails implicit counterfactuals, and that it is better to make them explicit if you want to evaluate the analysis properly. In this case, saying that Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union was a mistake entails counterfactual, usually implicit but sometimes stated outright, that had he not done it, Germany might have won the war.</p>
<p>Two related aspects of that statement trouble me. First, and perhaps less important, I also tend to agree with theorists of counterfactual analysis that if you’re going to posit an alternative path that history might have taken, you ought to identify the moment when it was at least possible. And I don’t know that anyone has ever identified a moment when Hitler could plausibly have said, well, I suppose I won’t invade the Soviet Union after all.</p>
<p>Which points us to the second, more major issue with the “mistake” formulation: from Hitler’s point of view, it was not a <em>mistake</em>; it was a central purpose of the German war and indeed the Nazi state to invade the USSR so as to seize, depopulate, and resettle land to the East. You can say that was a terrible idea; you can say it entailed genocidal atrocities. But it was not, for the Nazis, a mistake—it was one of the major reasons to be a Nazi.</p>
<p>Saying that it was a mistake fundamentally misunderstands the nature of Nazism. There could be no German victory without that conquest of territory in the East if you were a Nazi, which of course Hitler was. Saying it was a mistake for him to invade the USSR presupposes a Hitler who could somehow have been persuaded not to do so—a Hitler who was, somehow, not a Nazi, or anyway not a sincere one. And that’s a presupposition that beggars belief.</p>

  <title>North Africa maps</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/na_map/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img align="right" src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/na_map/na_combine.png" alt="Series of maps showing Italian, British, and German advances over the early years of the North Africa campaign." width="50%"></p>
<p>Students in World War II need to understand the North Africa campaigns both for a sense of what British imperial strategy was like, and for the competing demands on German resources in the critical year of 1941. But it’s a part of the world with which most of them are unfamiliar, so there’s a need of considerable deployment of maps. In the past we’ve often used proper military maps—like <a href="https://www.westpoint.edu/academics/academic-departments/history/digital-history-center/atlases/world-war-two-europe">the West Point ones</a>—but to be honest these are finer-grained than our students generally like.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not all that easy to make decent military maps, at least not for me. So campaigns like this one, where there’s a lot of back and forth, require some sort of in-between depiction—not quite a proper military map, but indicating the general sweep of battlefield events. I’m still working on finding the right balance.</p>
<p>In these, I’ve tried to indicate enough of the Eastern Mediterranean so students can grasp why this is an important region—I’ve got the endpoints of the Suez Canal, and Sicily is visible, indicating the potential hazard to Italy should the British gain complete control of Libya. I’ve decided not to put country names on this map, because we use them on larger maps (<a href="http://localhost:5505/posts/geolexigraph/">like this one</a>) and students should have a sense of what major locations are by this time of the class.</p>
<p>On the other hand I have placed the names of some important cities to help discussion of what’s at stake, and where.</p>

  <title>Mothballs</title>

  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/mothballs/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The US strategy for building up an Atlantic squadron depended on reactivating ships from the first world war, mothballed during the optimistic years of the 1920s. Roosevelt ordered their swifter return to duty at around the time of the Munich agreement, when he established the Atlantic Squadron—first as a smaller unit including only new cruisers, but soon attaching to it what had been the Training Squadron of older battleships and destroyers stationed on the East Coast.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>It took much longer than expected or hoped to revive the old ships, which had been laid firmly away and often with little or no record as to their peculiarities. It turned out to be fortunate that they returned to duty while the nation was still at peace and German ships were generally far away; their crews had to get their vessels in shape by sailing them to and beyond their limits, to discover what needed alteration and repair.<span class="citation" data-cites="abbaziaMrRooseveltNavy1975"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

  <title>Everything everywhere</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/assumptions/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Together with my colleague, and sometimes solo, I’ve been teaching our department’s course on the history of World War II for something like a dozen years. Students have always come to it with certain expectations, and while these vary over the years—and with the release of Hollywood movies set in the war—one kind of question crops up pretty much every time: “why didn’t the Allies [or Axis] just do <em>X?</em>” And usually X is something that occurred to the Allies, or Axis, to do—it was just that they did not have the resources to do X and also the other things they considered priorities. That is, for most of the war the question of allocating finite, often severely limited, resources that strategists believed better allocated elsewhere.</p>
<p>An illustration: early in 1941, Roosevelt was prepared to send the carrier <em>Yorktown</em> together with a group of battleships from the Pacific to the Atlantic to augment the existing fleet, and protect Lend-Lease shipping to Britain against U-boat attack. The Navy drew up plans for this proposal.</p>
<p>But then, in April, the Soviets and the Japanese agreed to a neutrality pact. Such a pact would assure the Soviets could focus on Europe and the Japanese on the Pacific, without having to worry about fighting each other. Because Japan now had a freer hand in the Pacific, the president changed his mind and sent only <em>Yorktown</em> to the Atlantic.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/assumptions/yorktown_va.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption"><em>Yorktown</em> at the dock in Norfolk, Virginia, 1941. Naval History and Heritage Command.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So this is the first limitation we need to remember: a limited quantity of resources, in this case ships of war. To move ships to the Atlantic to fight U-boats meant those ships wouldn’t be available in the Pacific to fend off an attack by Japan.</p>
<p>The second one is time. <em>Yorktown</em> departed Pearl Harbor on April 22, 1941, and arrived in Bermuda on May 12, 1941. It took three weeks to move from one posting to another.</p>
<p>This is the second limitation; that of time. To move resources from one theater to another is not instantaneous and thus not easy to reverse.</p>
<p>Roosevelt’s decision—or indecision, as it may be—was shaped by these limits: not enough ships to have adequate force everywhere, and a constraint of time such that allocation of resources was not easily reversed.</p>
<p>And limits like those shaped most decision-makers for most of the war. Roosevelt would have liked to leave enough ships on station in the Pacific while also devoting increased force to the Atlantic, but he couldn’t.</p>

  <title>Neutrality patrol 1939</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/slow_39/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The war in Europe had barely begun when the president urged his acting secretary of the navy, Charles Edison, to swifter action.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have been disturbed by (a) The slowness of getting the East Coast, Caribbean and Gulf patrol under way. (b) The lag between the making of contacts and the follow-up of the contact. . . . It is, therefore, necessary to make the following orders clear. . . . When any aircraft or surface ship sights a submarine a report thereof will be rushed to the Navy Department for immediate action. The plane or surface ship sighting a submarine will remain in contact as long as possible. . . . Planes or Navy or Coast Guard ships may report the sighting of any submarine or suspicious surface ship in plain English to Force Commander or Department. In this whole patrol business time is of the essence and loss of contact with surface ships cannot be tolerated.<span class="citation" data-cites="roosevelt1939"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 1939 the Atlantic Squadron, established September 6, 1938 by command of Admiral William Leahy, included four battleships—<em>New York, Arkansas, Texas,</em> and <em>Wyoming</em>—as well as a series of cruisers, destroyers, and the carrier <em>Ranger.</em></p>

</div>
<p>In addition, on September 14, 1939, the Navy announced that it would recommission forty of the old World War I destroyers then in mothballs to strengthen the neutrality patrols. A reporter asked the president about the patrol policy the next day.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Q Going back to the definition of territorial waters, is the fact that our ships are patroling two hundred miles out any indication that our territorial limits –<br>
THE PRESIDENT: (interposing) No, they are out there for information, nothing else.<span class="citation" data-cites="PressConference5791939"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this information was something the president regarded with great urgency.</p>

  <title>Quantifying German Jewish refugees, 1933–1938</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/rosenstock/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img align="right" src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/rosenstock/ros1.png" alt="Chart showing initial movement of refugees to Europe, then to Palestine, then to the USA over the period 1933--1938." width="50%"></p>
<p>So far as I can tell the best source of data on the number and direction of German Jews fleeing the Nazi regime remains Werner Rosenstock’s 1956 article, “Exodus, 1933–1939,” which has been reprinted a number of times including in the <em>Nazi Holocaust</em> collection and still sees citation in books on the subject.<span class="citation" data-cites="rosenstockExodus193319391989 dworkFlightReichRefugee2009"><sup>1</sup></span> Rosenstock himself noted that his figures were estimates only, and partial at that, though he did his best to check them against other source and ensure they provided at least an approximately accurate picture of trends and volumes. To make the graph at right I’ve had to do a little arithmetic to draw numbers out of Rosenstock’s article; he preferred to report propotions, probably to avoid a spurious precision—I say all that by way of trying to avoid a charge of making it appear more sure than it is.</p>
<p>Even so, I think it’s useful to attempt a graphical representation of the trends, because it allows us to see a few things that Rosenstock indicates in his article. First, that those who left Nazi Germany preferred hopefully to believe that they would not have to go far; that the madness would burn itself out and they could return home. So you see that other European countries were the initial first choice of those who fled Hitler’s regime.</p>
<p>Second, you can see that Palestine was the next-most popular choice—though it peaked in popularity early, in 1934, and in 1936, refugees were more likely to head for overseas destinations than for Palestine, perhaps because of the Arab uprising that began that year and which included attacks on Jewish settlements.</p>
<p>And last, you can see the increasing importance of the United States as a destination for Jewish refugees. (Note by the way that all the figures for 1938 include only half the year.) Although Rosenstock doesn’t disaggregate figures to overseas destinations for 1935 and 1936, one can suppose that the United States took a large amount of the refugees heading across oceans in those years as well.</p>
<p>Further, as Rosenstock notes, many of the refugees who first headed to European countries later sought destinations elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For many, residence in these countries was to be only temporary. The difficulties both in the administrative sphere (residence and labour permits) and in the economic field often made absorption impossible and resulted in re-emigration. In retrospect, those ‘unfortunate’ re-emigrants who could not strike roots in their country of sojourn were more fortunate than their fellow-refugees who stayed behind and fell victims to the invading Nazis during the war.<span class="citation" data-cites="rosenstockExodus193319391989"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, by 1938, the global disposition of the approximately 107,000 German Jewish refugees who found their way overseas looked something like the below, according to what Rosenstock describes as “semi-official” figures.<span class="citation" data-cites="rosenstockExodus193319391989"><sup>3</sup></span></p>

  <title>The Holocaust as a historian’s problem</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/epist/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The effort to <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/stone/">quantify the dead of the Holocaust</a> inspires a queasy feeling, as of dealing with the genuinely obscene, but it is a necessary methodological substitute for the evidentiary absence at the center of the event: that is to say, we have no representative subjective account of it. That is to say, we have survivors’ accounts but, as Primo Levi (among others) points out, survivors’ accounts are not representative. The representative Jewish experience of the Holocaust was death.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I must repeat: we, the survivors, are not the true witnesses. . . . We survivors are not only an exiguous but also an anomalous minority: we are those who by their prevarications or abilities or good luck did not touch bottom. Those who did so, those who saw the Gorgon, have not returned to tell about it or have returned mute, but they are the ‘Muslims,’ the submerged, the complete witnesses, the ones whose deposition would have a general significance. They are the rule, we are the exception.<span class="citation" data-cites="leviDrownedSaved1986"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a shocking thing to consider: that, for example, <a href="https://www.yadvashem.org/holocaust/about/fate-of-jews/poland.html#narrative_info">of the 3.3 million Jews who lived in Poland in 1939, perhaps 380,000 survived</a> the war. Historians generally use first-hand testimony of great historical events as an indication of what it must have been like to experience the event. A survivor’s testimony cannot serve that purpose when the dead outnumber the survivors by something like 7.6 to 1.</p>

<p>Of the effort to arrive at a number of Jews murdered in the Nazi death camps, Yitzhak Arad writes,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There were never any records of the killing activities in these camps: the entire operation was <em>Geheime Reichssache—</em>a secret matter of the Reich, and any written documentation on what was actually taking place in the death camps would have exposed the secret. The deportation orders and reports on their implementation were sometimes written down but usually given orally. Even the SS men who served in the camps were utterly prohibited from counting the number of Jews they murdered, or even to discuss the matter. SS <em>Unterscharführer</em> Robert Jührs, when asked at the Belzec war crimes trial on the number of Jews murdered in the camp responded: “In the matter of this question, permit me to emphasize that we were explicitly prohibited from discussing numbers.”<span class="citation" data-cites="aradOperationReinhardDeath2018"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Germans used the railways to deport Jews from the Polish towns and ghettos to Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka to be killed, and railways run on bureaucracy; they must know when trains leave and how many cars are on them. Arad was able to discover records of 480 or so such trains and, knowing that “the Germans pushed 100 to 150 people into each freight car,” arrive at an estimate of their burden.<span class="citation" data-cites="aradOperationReinhardDeath2018"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>Auschwitz presents a trickier problem because it was not solely a death camp. Deportees arriving in the camp went through a selection process from which some were registered and sent to labor; the unregistered were sent to their death. One must therefore look at the number of deportees and the number registered and in most cases, as Robert Jan van Pelt writes, “All the deportees were either killed on arrival, and therefore not registered; or admitted to the camp and registered.”<span class="citation" data-cites="vanpeltCaseAuschwitzEvidence2016"><sup>3</sup></span> He cites the work of Franciszek Piper, who in the 1980s began working from previously compiled documentation and estimates to arrive at reliable figures.<span class="citation" data-cites="piperEstimatingNumberDeportees1991"><sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p>In 2019, Lewi Stone put together a data series including Arad’s and Piper’s figures, together with some more representing Jews killed by the <em>Einsatzgrüppen</em> during the invasion of the Soviet Union (the “Shoah by bullet”) to come up with a time series showing the number of Jews murdered in the death camps as against Auschwitz and by shooting. Stone’s concern is the intensity of this genocide as against others, but for the purpose of teaching World War II, it’s more useful for showing the timing of the Holocaust and its relation to the other events of the war. Stone’s article doesn’t have his raw data, but <a href="https://theconversation.com/quantifying-the-holocaust-measuring-murder-rates-during-the-nazi-genocide-108984">a piece he wrote for The Conversation</a> does.<span class="citation" data-cites="stoneQuantifyingHolocaustHyperintense2019"><sup>5</sup></span> From it one can make a chart such as the below.</p>

  <title>Travel by map</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/travel_map/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In <em>The Muppets</em> (2011) the almost fully reunited gang, together with Jason Segel and Amy Adams, need to travel to France from the United States to find Miss Piggy. They have a car and (robot; don’t ask) driver; they discuss how they can get there from here.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIQKVITyaMI" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Like much Muppet humor, this joke asks the viewer to have a knowledge of show business tropes, of which “travel by map” is one. Many of us will probably associate it with Indiana Jones; here’s what we see when, in <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark,</em> Indy leaves Marshall College (University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA in real life and apparently fictionally located in Northern California as well) to find Marian in Nepal, traveling by flying boat.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Travel by map in <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Of course, as with the Muppets, much that is in Indiana Jones is pastiche and homage, and the travel by map sequence serves the same purpose here as it did thirty years later: nudging the viewer to say see, this is like those old-timey movies. But which ones?</p>
<p>The best known example I can think of is <em>Casablanca.</em> At the beginning, the narrator tells us about the refugee trail that leads people fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe to the Vichy-controlled city. As he talks, we see their path, shifting from globe to map.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Travel by map in <em>Casablanca.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I don’t know where this trope originated but I wouldn’t be surprised to learn it came from, or became common during, the years around World War II. As Susan Schulten <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/117835/richard-edes-harrison-reinvented-mapmaking-world-war-2-americans">points out,</a> more Americans saw more maps of more kinds because of the war. Many had never before been overseas or even had to think about it much.<span class="citation" data-cites="schultenGeographicalImaginationAmerica2002"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><em>Casablanca</em> of course dramatizes the American journey from isolation to intervention in the character arc of Rick Blaine. Maybe it’s also the first real popular instance of the geographical awareness that made that arc possible.</p>

  <title>The literature of the Irving case</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/irving/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>David Irving sued the historian Deborah Lipstadt for libel in 1996, and lost in 2000, when an English judge’s opinion held that Lipstadt was justified in her characterization of Irving in her book <em>Denying the Holocaust.</em> It was one of the most exciting and high-stakes things to happen to historiography during my professional career; that I happened to be teaching history in England at the time magnified it as an event in my imagination.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/irving/large_HU_059545_A.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">SS officers of Auschwitz and Belsen awaiting trial at Lüneberg, 1945. Imperial War Museum.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Lipstadt wrote a book about it, <em>History on Trial,</em> but in this post I want to focus on the books written by historians called to give expert opinions in the case, because it seems to me they were asked to do something unusual for professional historians, but perhaps helpful.</p>
<p>For a while I used to assign graduate students Richard Evans’s <em>Telling Lies About Hitler</em> because it echoed his title <em>Telling the Truth About History,</em> and tied into his broader concerns about the historical profession.<span class="citation" data-cites="evansTellingLiesHitler2002"><sup>1</sup></span> But I came to feel that this feature, which attracted me, was making the book less good for graduate students; Evans may perhaps assume too much of readers, expecting them to know his particular position regarding evidence and argumentation, and to be too aware of the arguments he opposes.</p>
<p>But what his book has, and shares with the others, is an awareness that what the trial asked of historians is not what ordinary scholarship asks of historians—although maybe it should: an aggressively forensic approach to developing the evidence for a case and establishing, point by point, the narrative we know. As Robert Jan van Pelt says in his book,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I was to write a report on the evidence of our knowledge about Auschwitz fifty-five years after the world had first learned of the atrocities in that camp, amid a society that had reached a consensus about what happened at Auschwitz.<span class="citation" data-cites="vanpeltCaseAuschwitzEvidence2016"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the crucible of a legal case, what we think we know must be, if not discarded, then picked carefully apart to rediscover its basis. Van Pelt’s book, <em>The Case for Auschwitz,</em> seems to me now the most useful of the three, because he explicitly develops the nature of the problem he, and other expert witnesses, faced. He returns—as I think one should—to Marc Bloch for a discussion of the nature of evidence and historical proof.</p>
<p>The third expert book that is of occasional use to me as a teacher is Peter Longerich’s <em>Unwritten Order,</em> about Hitler’s personal role in the Holocaust. Perhaps we have no document reading, “Dear Heinrich and Reinhard, Please go ahead and kill all the Jews, like we discussed. Kisses, Adolf.” But there is copious evidence of Hitler’s involvement in the evolution of the Final Solution.<span class="citation" data-cites="longerichUnwrittenOrderHitler2003"><sup>3</sup></span> And this is a question students, perhaps immersed in “just-asking-questions” internet forums or worse, sometimes pose in class.</p>
<p>Karl Jaspers has what I think is a funny line:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We are always ready to flee from creative work into that which is automatic. On days when the savant makes no progress in his researches, he is still able to give an expert opinion.<span class="citation" data-cites="jaspersOriginGoalHIstory2021"><sup>4</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But as these books show, there is nothing automatic about the best expert opinions.</p>

  <title>Ray Moley as a source</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/moley/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Historians often rely on Raymond Moley’s memoirs for accounts of the early New Deal.<span class="citation" data-cites="moleySevenYears1939 moleyFirstNewDeal1966"><sup>1</sup></span> I have been skeptical of leaning too hard on these sources: memoirs written after the fact are fallible because memory is fallible; moreover, Moley left the administration because he disagreed with Roosevelt’s policies and he came to disagree with them even more, ultimately contributing to Barry Goldwater’s speeches, and so this rupture colored his recollection. But most of all, his memoirs are like all memoirs “intentional,” to use Marc Bloch’s term; as historians we generally prefer sources that serve as “witnesses in spite of themselves.” That is, Moley (like all memoirists) composed his memoirs and in that act of composition made decisions in keeping with his intentions, seeking to influence historical narrative. We’d rather have a document written in 1933 whose author didn’t necessarily mean it to see the light of day, which was supposed to communicate something of importance in 1933, and which therefore unintentionally bears witness when we look at it now.<span class="citation" data-cites="blochHistorianCraft1953"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/moley/moley.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Raymond Moley (right) greets Senator William Borah (R-ID) as Moley arrives in Congress to testify in opposition to the president’s judicial reform bill, 1937. Library of Congress.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I was able to look at Moley’s papers in the Hoover Institution at Stanford some years ago. They are full of witnesses in spite of themselves, but they also include evidence of Moley’s intention to shape the historical record, which is perhaps more than anything else what put me on alert as to his reliability. Notably, Moley’s papers include the diary of his assistant, Celeste Jedel, covering January 1 to August 1, 1933—essentially, the short period when Moley was of at least some consequence to the Roosevelt administration. Moley directed that this diary be kept sealed until 1976, and included a covering memorandum to researchers, which he wrote in 1972 on his Phoenix, Arizona, stationery.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The diary which accompanies this statement was written by my assistant, Celeste Jedel. . . . It was written at my direction. . . . at the end of every day I explained to her what I wanted recorded in the diary, telling her whom I had seen and where I had been in my periods out of the office. . . . She was a brilliant girl and had a photographic memory, so that the entries are all correct, but since she was only 22 years old, her judgment about what should go into the diary was sometimes faulty. In other words, she included certain comments of her own which did not represent my opinion. . . . I would not have these exposed now since some of the individuals are living, and in other cases there are relatives. I did not agree with her evaluations.<sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This note says a lot, I think, especially when read together with the diary and with knowledge of Moley’s general attitude toward the early Roosevelt administration. Moley really seems to want to have it both ways: the diary belongs in his papers because he directed it be written but also it includes things he didn’t say should go in it. He didn’t agree with what she said but she was brilliant and had a photographic memory. Also the entries are all correct! I think one can parse this passage so that these things are all true at once, but it requires hard work, and it also requires you to believe that Moley’s grasp of the past from forty years onward be better than Jedel’s contemporary commentary. It is much more likely that Moley in 1972 was uncomfortable with some of the candid, and true, observations that Jedel made in 1933, which often include tart evaluations of other people in the administration, not all of which seem to a judicious historian at all inconsistent with what we know of Moley’s opinions.</p>
<p>Whether the historian reading Moley’s covering note accepts, a historian should certainly understand it as an indication that Moley remained, decades later, deeply concerned with how he appeared in 1933. He wanted that moment remembered, to be sure, because it was the moment when he was nearest to power and maybe exercised a little of it. But also he wanted it remembered in a particular way; he was ambivalent later about what he did and said then. Which is maybe no different than any other historical figure, but Moley’s note serves as an unusually express reminder to the historian to take care with Moley’s intentional versions of the historical record.</p>

  <title>Pan Am for hemispheric defense</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/pan_am/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Shortly after the German invasion of France in June 1940, the Roosevelt administration authorized Pan American Airways to build and maintain airfields for the US military. The army and navy wanted a network of coastal bases to assure access to Natal, in the eastern part of Brazil—at the narrowest point of the Atlantic. The administration determined that signing a deal with Pan Am would be quicker than undertaking any more formal process, and as Congress had given Roosevelt a discretionary fund of $34 million for such purposes on June 11 in the naval appropriations act, it was swiftly done.<sup>1</sup> According to General George Marshall, these airfields were “more essential to out national defense than any other single matter.”<span class="citation" data-cites="connWesternHemisphereFramework1960"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Pan Am Mural from Rockefeller Center. Library of Congress.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>These bases would not, for the most part, be the bases acquired from Britain in trade for old US destroyers, though Pan Am played a small part in setting up the base in Trinidad. These would be new bases, in which Pan Am had its own interest—it wanted a network of runways that would suit the new stratoliner, the first passenger aircraft with a pressurized cabin, <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/boeing-307-stratoliner-clipper-flying-cloud/nasm_A19730267000">which shared components with the B-17.</a></p>
<p>Settling on locations for the bases entailed some difficulties. The planners wanted one in Martinique, but the island’s Vichy proclivities made that impossible. The Vichy governor in French Guiana was a bit more obliging and worked with Pan Am in secret—until the Nazis kicked him out.</p>
<p>Although Pan Am made a slow start, the airfields ultimately proved vital, especially in managing traffic to and from Europe bound through Natal. Moreover, as Marshall said in April 1941, the network constituted an investment: “an asset to us for military use and for future trade relations. Anything we can do now toward providing airfields is an enduring thing and not a venture.”<span class="citation" data-cites="connWesternHemisphereFramework1960"><sup>3</sup></span></p>

  <title>Franklin Roosevelt, budget-cutter</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/budgets/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Much as I crankily complain about e-texts (tldr; for scholarly use and for instruction they are not as accessible as they should be), we live in an age of wonderful online documents, including the US Treasury Bulletin, of which one may find the December 1940 number <a href="https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/treasury-bulletin-407/december-1940-6528">here.</a> And in that number one may find the Treasury’s own breakdown of the New Deal budgets, which I depict here in graphical format.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/budgets/budg2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">US budgets, 1933–1940 by Treasury categories, dividing “ordinary” from “New Deal” expenditures.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>During the 1932 campaign, Franklin Roosevelt tried (as candidates often do) to have his cake and eat it too—that is, to promise both that he would be more frugal than Herbert Hoover and that he would spend extraordinary sums on unemployment relief as part of his New Deal. Roosevelt gave a respectable cast to this pledge to have it both ways by distinguishing between the “ordinary” expenditures of the federal government, which he would cut, and the necessary emergency expenditures of the New Deal, which would grow as large as they must to provide relief. As he said in his speech on the budget in Pittsburgh, (<a href="http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/msf/msf00570">transcript here</a>) under Hoover “our Federal Government has experienced unprecedented deficits,” which needed paying for in taxation, “a brake on any return to normal business activity.” He proposed therefore to cut the expenditures of the federal government—while excepting the emergency expenditures necessary for the New Deal:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>what I am talking about more especially tonight are the taxes which go to the ordinary costs of conducting government year in and year out—and that is where the question of extravagance comes in. There can be no extravagance when starvation is in question; but extravagance does apply to the mounting budget of the Federal Government in Washington during these past four years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roosevelt kept budget-cutting a priority, while also preserving this exception, once inaugurated. The first major New Deal measure after the banking and currency legislation was the Economy Act, which gave the president extraordinary powers to cut the budget. On March 24, 1933, just after the passage of the Economy Act, <a href="http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/pc/pc0184.pdf">a reporter asked Roosevelt</a> if he would balance the budget, and the president gave an answer that hewed to the distinction, however inventive, he had made during the campaign.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Press conference remarks distinguishing ordinary from emergency spending. FDRL</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As you can see from the chart, Roosevelt (through his budget-cutting deputy Lewis Douglas) used the Economy Act’s authority to reduce what he considered “ordinary” federal spending in his first budget, and the “ordinary” expenses of the government remained down through his first term. Of course, he more than made up for that drop with New Deal spending.</p>

<p>Today’s fun source is the “Geolexigraph of the Neutrality Act of 1939,” in the Department of Commerce’s own journal, <em>Comparative Law Series,</em> of May 1940.<span class="citation" data-cites="perkinsGeolexigraphNeutralityAct1940"><sup>1</sup></span> The journal provided information to US businesses on how to navigate US laws and policy; this particular article included all manner of information from the Department of Commerce itself, the post office, the Department of State, the customs office, and various other entities on how not to run afoul of the neutrality act passed just after the beginning of World War II in Europe.</p>
<p>But beware! for the Commerce Department folks introduced an error into their reproduction of the president’s declaration of a combat area under the law, and two of the geographic points are swapped. The original authoritative source is in the Department of State’s own bulletin.<span class="citation" data-cites="ProclamationDefiningCombat1940"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>And for yet more fun here is a map showing that same combat area.</p>

  <title>Basics of the Greer speech</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Ultimately, what troubles me most about standard accounts of the <em>Greer</em> incident is the tendency to treat evidence showing the U-boat captain didn’t know the destroyer was a US ship as a gotcha for the Roosevelt administration. Roosevelt’s speech on the incident, and the policy he announced as a result, didn’t depend on the U-boat captain knowing <em>Greer</em> was a US ship; in fact, Roosevelt quite expressly said otherwise.</p>
<p>A transcript of the president’s remarks as delivered appear in the Master Speech File at the Roosevelt Library in the second folder on this address; <a href="http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/msf/msf01445">big pdf link here.</a></p>
<p>Here’s what seems to me the most important passage, so far as the <em>Greer</em> incident itself goes:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/greer_speech/speech.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Excerpt from the transcript of Roosevelt’s national broadcast of September 11, 1941, speech file 1381B, box 62, Master Speech File, FDRL.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Roosevelt does say before this passage that it was broad daylight and the destroyer was flying the American flag. Moreover he imputes to the U-boat commander the “deliberate design to sink her.”</p>
<p>But the key, so far as his argument goes, seems to me here: <em>if</em> the German U-boat saw <em>Greer</em> was a US ship and fired at her, that’s an act of war—but! if it <em>didn’t</em> see <em>Greer</em> and ascertain her identity, that’s “even more outrageous”; it’s “indiscriminate violence,” and even worse.</p>
<p>Thus Roosevelt’s argument does not hinge on the Germans’ knowing they were firing on a US ship. You’d never know it the way many historians talk about it. For example:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a fireside chat delivered on September 11, FDR deliberately distorted the details of the incident. He claimed that the <em>Greer’s</em> identity as a U.S. ship was unmistakable and that the German submarine fired first without warning. He went on to outline a Nazi design to abolish the freedom of the seas as a prelude to domination of the United States.<span class="citation" data-cites="schuesslerDeceptionDividendFDR2010"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Roosevelt’s speech didn’t, as I say, depend on <em>Greer’s</em> identity as a US ship. Much to the contrary; he says it’s actually worse if the U-boat didn’t know it. (Moreover, as previously noted, the Nazis <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/greer_2_nazi/">absolutely did mean to abolish freedom of the seas as prelude to war with the United States.</a>)</p>
<p>Further: Roosevelt then goes on in the speech to outline a pattern. The Germans had previously sunk the US merchantman <em>Robin Moor,</em> the Panamanian ship <em>Sessa,</em> and the US merchant vessel <em>Steel Seafarer.</em> You could reasonably suppose the Germans didn’t particularly care whose ships they were sinking.</p>
<p>Indeed, historians now know—or should know, at any rate—that’s precisely the case, both in the specific case of the <em>Greer</em> and in general. In the National Archives, one may find a decrypted message from Lt. Fraatz, of U 652, to the German commander of submarines, dated September 5, 1941, explaining he had fired torpedoes at “DESTROYER, FLING [<em>sic</em>] UNKNOWN FLAG.”<span class="citation" data-cites="fraatz1941"><sup>2</sup></span> <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/greer_4_facts_2/">Fraatz knew <em>Greer</em> wasn’t acting like a British ship.</a> <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/greer_5_confusion/">He didn’t think it was a British ship.</a> He was puzzled by its behavior, and he didn’t know whose ship it was. But he fired on it anyway. Which is what Roosevelt described as “even more outrageous” than knowing it was a US ship.</p>
<p>Perhaps Fraatz, via the various communications channels of Raeder’s navy, absorbed the message given by Hitler earlier in the summer. On July 25, 1941, one of the many occasions when Hitler urged patience, awaiting the right moment to attack the United States, he said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>His original view has undergone no changes whatsoever. He would, however, like to avoid having the U.S.A. declare war while the Eastern Campaign is still in progress, also out of consideration for the Army which is involved in heavy combat. But he will never call a submarine commander to account if he torpedoes an American ship by mistake.<span class="citation" data-cites="FuehrerConferencesNaval1990"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I say, Fraatz’s specific behavior reflects this general carelessness. The <em>Greer</em> might have been an American ship; it might not. But there was no harm in shooting at it if it were. That’s precisely the view that Roosevelt objected to, describing it as “piracy.”</p>

  <title>Chiseling on Justice</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/jurisdiction/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The Roosevelt administration considered a series of methods to improve an obstructionist federal judiciary in the 1930s; its best known was the Judicial Reform Bill of 1937, which sought to increase the membership of the federal bench, but before that officials seriously considered the idea of “jurisdiction stripping,” or removing the Court’s right to hear certain kinds of cases.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>The US constitution, in Article III, grants only limited original jurisdiction to the Court—that is, cases in which the Court is the first resort. So for example, disputes between states come in the first place before the Supreme Court. It appellate jurisdiction—that is, cases that can come to the Court for appeal after decision elsewhere—is broader, including “all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under the Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority”—but “with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.”</p>
<p>This latter clause has been interpreted by the Court to allow Congress to remove certain classes of cases from the Court’s purview. The preeminent example was <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/74/506"><em>Ex Parte McCardle</em> of 1868.</a></p>
<p>Officers of the Department of Justice considered this possibility fraught for various reasons but chiefly for a practical one:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court were to be abolished, District Courts and Circuit Courts of Appeals would still be in a position to declare statutes unconstitutional if such questions arose in cases brought before them. A statute preventing the inferior courts from declaring statutes unconstitutional would itself be invalid, in view of the doctrine of <em>Marbury v. Madison.</em><span class="citation" data-cites="holtzoffMemorandumAttorneyGeneral1935"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One has only to look at recent, conflicting decisions in federal districts to see this problem in action, such as in 2014 when <a href="https://www.glaad.org/blog/6th-circuit-court-appeals-upholds-ban-marriage-same-sex-couples">the Sixth Circuit upheld bans on marrying someone of the same gender, while other courts upheld it;</a> absent a final court of appeal, there might be no way to resolve such a conflict. This concern prevailed within the Roosevelt administration, which turned to expansion instead.</p>
<p>Scholars since then have suggested what <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Moyn-Testimony.pdf">Samuel Moyn calls “channeling” or “fine-tuning” jurisdiction,</a> including requiring by statute a super-majority on the Court for invalidating a federal statute, or reassigning final jurisdiction for invalidating a federal statute to Congress itself, which would have to ratify a Supreme Court decision to strike down a federal law.</p>
