<p>I was looking through a drawer and came across a Bob Dylan-adjacent thing I’d written and forgotten, because <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/erauchway/cv_pub/blob/main/rauchway_cv.html">my cv</a> has only the academic stuff on it. Given the Discourse around <em>A Complete Unknown,</em> I thought I’d share.</p>
<p>Conor McPherson (who wrote <em>The Weir</em>) wrote and directed <em>Girl From the North Country,</em> a play featuring the songs of Bob Dylan. Set in a boarding-house in Duluth, Minnesota in 1934, it wove Dylan’s songs (performed on Depression-era instruments) through a story about that hard time.</p>
<p><em>Girl From the North Country</em> was opening at the Old Vic in the summer of 2017; the director of the company producing the program(me) wrote to ask me if I’d contribute an essay on the state of the country, and Minnesota, at that time. So of course I said yes. They sent me the script, I wrote the essay based on the themes I saw in the play, and it went into the programme under the title “A Most Dangerous Time.” When the production moved to the Noël Coward Theatre in the West End a few months later, they kindly kept the essay in the new programme. The text of it appears below the pictures.</p>

<p>The end of 1934 brought a most dangerous time to America. The four Depression winters following the 1929 crash came on hard. Each one worse than the one before, with more out of work, more going hungry, more on the roads, more families broken up and people broken down. Despair stole over the nation’s soul.</p>
<p>But then in 1933 a slender hope seized the citizens who could see that just ever so slightly, things might start getting better. With a new president and a New Deal came new jobs, and a hard, long road along which Americans were nevertheless heading in the right direction, toward work and dignity and an end to the waking nightmare of grinding want. The president, Franklin Roosevelt, knew how terrible a thing this little hope could be. Before, in the forlorn depths of the Depression, Americans had known chiefly how to suffer. But now, with a little hope in them, they sensed their improved prospects, and felt a new restlessness. And it was, Roosevelt worried, ‘disappointed hope, rather than despair, [that] creates revolutions,’ and with this fragile and unrealised hope in them the people stirred that winter on the brink of action, not knowing which way they might lurch.</p>
<p>Minnesotans felt it, the risk that came with a little hope in 1934. They spent the summer enthralled by an industrial civil war that was called out on the state’s radio stations as if it were a football game pitting communists against capitalists.</p>
<p>The fertile prairie state, rich in grain and home to the headwaters of the Mississippi, had become in the industrial age the trucking hub of the American north-west, where the produce of the heartland could be processed, packed and shipped out again. In the years of the Depression, with scarcely any work to be had, the prices people could pay had fallen so low that it was hardly worth a farmer’s while to harvest the crops in the fields, for the pittance they would fetch if brought to market. Wheat went to seed and corn rotted on the stalk.</p>
<p>But in 1934, with business picking up, the flow of goods into the state’s cities resumed, and on this tide of renewed commerce came an opportunity for workers to claim a portion of prosperity. They formed unions, asking for better wages. There were actual communists among the labour leaders, a fact to which the state’s businessmen pointed in rage but, under the circumstances, to little effect. Minnesota boasted a unique achievement: a daily union newspaper, <em>The Organizer,</em> that turned a profit, and it editorialised in a workingman’s voice that ‘these here bosses we got in town keep yellin’ in the papers that communism and payin’ 54½ cents an hour is one an’ the same thing. Well, if that’s what it is I guess I’m a communist an’ I expect most every one in the world . . . must be too.’</p>
<p>The union went on strike, shutting trucking down in Minneapolis for more than a month in the summer heat. Strikers and policemen fought in the streets. In one clash, the policemen ambushed strikers, shooting them in the back as they turned to run, killing a few and sending dozens to the hospital. The governor, Floyd Olson, a member of the Farmer-Labor Party, had to declare martial law and personally prevailed on President Roosevelt to intervene—which he did, assigning a mediator to force a resolution recognising the union, setting minimum wages and maximum hours. The governor and the president believed they had averted revolution by giving a little to the workingmen; the city’s business owners thought the politicians had capitulated to the radicals and they resolved not to let this new state of affairs last.</p>
<p>In November, Olson would have to defend himself against the charge of abetting revolution, explaining that ‘Communists believe in the abolition of private property. We believe in its creation.’ He pulled out a narrow victory, returned to office mainly on account of votes from the workingmen of Minnesota.</p>
<p>It was so easy for Americans then and later to see the clash of classes as a struggle solely between groups of white people. One of the great novelists of the Great Depression, John Steinbeck, made his reputation by writing a novel, In Dubious Battle, based on a California strike—omitting the Mexicans and Mexican Americans who were, in real life, most of the workers.<span class="citation" data-cites="olmstedRightOutCalifornia2015"><sup>1</sup></span> It was easier to sell books and inspire white people to sympathy for the poor, if the poor were not also people with darker skins. But race played a major role in shaping the Great Depression.</p>
<p>As one African American observed, black people in America were familiar with hard times long before the 1929 crash. ‘The Negro was born in depression. It didn’t mean too much to him, The Great American Depression, as you call it. There was no such thing. The best he could be is a janitor or shoeshine boy. It only became official when it hit the white man.’</p>
<p>The generation of African Americans who old in the Great Depression had been young in slavery. They could remember when the US government had promised them civil rights and, even better, they could remember when it had failed to deliver, allowing white supremacists to reassert control over first the South, and then much of the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Indeed, by the middle of the 20th century, Minnesota, far in the north of the country and overwhelmingly white, was one of the few US states that did not have laws mandating racial segregation. As racial segregation spread across the South in the early 20th century, black Americans began to move north and west, to better opportunities and less racist cities like Minneapolis and Duluth, where a few hundred African Americans lived by the time of the Depression.</p>
<p>It was moving that gave the greatest hope to African Americans, moving out of the South to a part of the country where white folks’ prejudice, though vicious, did not altogether stop black citizens from staking a claim to their rights.</p>
<p>In the Depression, all kinds of people sought relief by moving. Maybe they had lost a job and a home or a farm and all went on the road together, a family living out of whatever excuse for an automobile they could find, like Steinbeck’s fictitious Joad clan headed from Oklahoma to California in <em>The Grapes of Wrath.</em> Maybe—more often—it was one man alone, leaving his family and relieving them of the burden his empty stomach imposed, hoping he would find work and be able to send a little money home. A woman and her children were more sympathetic, more deserving of charity, without a working-age man in the house.</p>
<p>Often it was the crush of debt that caused families to split up or lose their homes this way; it happened all over the country through the Depression and more in 1934, as a drought set in on the plains. With ever-lower incomes, farmers couldn’t afford their mortgages. Bankers, deprived of their payments, seized homes and farms in a wave of foreclosures.</p>
<p>In 1934, owing to Minnesota, the highest court in the nation was deciding whether the government could do anything to relieve its citizens from this financial crush. Fearing a revolution from the state’s overburdened borrowers, Governor Olson declared that—for a while at least—no sheriff, constable or police officer of the state could carry out a bank’s order to foreclose. The legislature backed him up. As Olson said, he didn’t know if he had the legal authority to stop banks, even temporarily, from taking Minnesotans’ houses, but it was necessary for ‘preserving order within the boundaries of this state.’</p>
<p>Asked to decide whether the state could thus step in to fend off the bankers, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes of the US Supreme Court ruled in 1934 that it might. Even though the right of private property was vital to the American tradition, the Chief Justice cited ‘a growing appreciation of public needs and of the necessity of finding ground for a rational compromise between individual rights and public welfare’ to let Minnesota lawmakers force a sense of mercy on the state’s creditors and permit a moratorium on foreclosures.</p>
<p>Earthly mercy is never so eternal as the divine variety. Even with this relief from state and federal authorities, the Depression would continue to weigh on Americans of all kinds. The state could stave off debt, give you a job, afford relief, but the sum total of the reckoning one owed might still seem insurmountable. The suicide rate generally rises with unemployment, and it peaked in 1932. But even a couple of years onward it had not dropped to an ordinary level. Americans still had an uncertain hope in what this world could offer, and wavered between faith in their ability to save each other, and unbelief.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I had the opportunity of a pleasant chat with Don Wildman of <em>American History Hit</em> about the Hoover-to-Roosevelt era (arguably a thing I’m expert on) and it became two episodes of that podcast, which you can listen to here if you like:</p>
<p><a href="https://shows.acast.com/american-history-hit/episodes/president-herbert-hoover-did-he-cause-the-great-depression">Hoover</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shows.acast.com/american-history-hit/episodes/fdr-the-new-deal">Roosevelt</a></p>
<p>I do like the opportunity of a good talk about these things, and judging by the email one gets sometimes people like to listen to them.</p>

<p>This post is no profounder than to observe that this (rather lovely, to me) Jack Delano photo of 1941, for the Farm Security Administration, of sugarcane cultivators at the Bethlehem estate of the Virgin Islands Company on St.&nbsp;Croix, reminds me of the Winslow Homer painting, “The Veteran in a New Field,” of 1865.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The Bethlehem estate on St.&nbsp;Croix was a property previously worked by the (Danish) West Indian Sugar Company, which the Roosevelt administration succeeded in purchasing and parceling out as homesteads available only to Virgin Islanders or people who had already been resident in the Virgin Islands for three years (most went to native Crucians; fewer to Puerto Rican migrants). The Virgin Islands Company bought the homesteaders’ sugarcane, making some of it into Government House Rum. That also is a whole other story, though.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>If you recognize the Homer painting and not from seeing it at the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11145">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York, it’s because it’s the cover illustration of Tom Petty’s album, <em>Southern Accents.</em> The veteran is, as the description reads, a US army veteran.

<p>People sometimes ask, “what professional opinion of yours is most likely to have you like—”</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/williams_hoover/flynn_swords.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>A still of Flynn from the movie <em>Tangled,</em> standing blithely in the center of a circle of swords pointed at his face; it is a popular meme for designating unpopular opinions.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Here’s my answer: scholars of US foreign policy have been far too generous in their treatment of interwar opponents of anti-Nazi foreign policy as proposed and practiced by the Roosevelt administration. I can understand the logic: there is ample reason to oppose many instances of US overseas militarism after 1945; none would have been possible without World War II, which created the modern US military state and the intellectual framework that supports it; therefore the creation of that state and framework must have been a mistake and further, the opponents of it must have had good ideas.</p>
<p>I’ll use this post to lay out the basic problem by looking at an essay by a, if not <em>the,</em> preeminent New Left historian of US foreign policy, writing about a, if not <em>the,</em> preeminent opponent of Franklin Roosevelt’s way of thinking.</p>
<p>Writing in 1970, William A. Williams complained that “Izzy Stone” too-frequently compared President Richard Nixon to Herbert Hoover; if both were Quakers, Williams said, “there we have a case of no difference with a fantastic distinction.”<span class="citation" data-cites="williamsWhatThisCountry1970"><sup>1</sup></span> The remark shows how little Williams understood Hoover, or Nixon: In 1930, President Hoover authorized Lewis Strauss to use “the services of any one of our various government secret services” to secure documents indicating how Democratic politicians planned to criticize him. <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/oppenheimer/">Strauss tasked an agent of the Office of Naval Intelligence to break into a Democratic Party headquarters in search of such documents.</a> Four decades later, Nixon would do something similar with less-capable burglars and get caught. Hoover and Nixon had in common the belief they could use the sinews of government for their own purposes, whatever the law said.<span class="citation" data-cites="dorwartConflctDutyNavy1983"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>They shared this belief in part because they believed they were on the right side of a great moral battle; Hoover and Nixon thought the New Deal had let into government “a stream of treason”—that was Hoover’s phrase, when he wrote Nixon to congratulate him for bringing Alger Hiss to book.<span class="citation" data-cites="olmstedRightOutCalifornia2015"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p>I mention this because I want to point out how ill-informed was Williams’s enthusiasm for Hoover. Williams liked Herbert Hoover because he thought “Hoover was against The Empire.” One of the twentieth century’s foremost scholars of the history of US foreign policy, which he understood as the history of a specific kind of imperialism, Williams helped to rehabilitate Hoover and other Republicans of the interwar period by claiming them for his cause. They too opposed US imperialism, for which they were vilified by historians in the business of “levitating Godfather Franklin.”<span class="citation" data-cites="williamsWhatThisCountry1970"><sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p>Roosevelt wanted to increase US military and diplomatic power because he opposed the rise of Nazi Germany, among other aggressor powers. Hoover was more bothered by the New Deal than by Nazism; he thought of them as two sides of the same coin, and the New Deal was here, which Nazism was not.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In emotional politics. . . . You need a devil if you are going to succeed. Their devil is the Jew. In the United States it is economic royalists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Nazis posed no threat to anyone outside Germany, Hoover thought: “they have no desire to dominate any but their own race.” And the inevitability of counterattack precluded a European war. “Europe is all cheek by jowl, they can reprise pretty easy . . . which will neutralize any danger of attack.”<span class="citation" data-cites="rauchwayWinterWarHoover2018"><sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p>In my view Hoover, and by extension Williams, was wrong about all these things: I think the New Deal did much not only to preserve what existed of US democracy, but to extend it, and also to oppose fascism. I think the Nazis posed a threat to people other than Germans. And I think the inevitability of counterattack did not rule out a European war.</p>
<p>Williams by contrast regarded Hoover’s focus on opposition to the New Deal as “so right it shakes you.” Moreover, Williams firmly believed the essence of Hoover’s foreign policy was that “he recognized the necessity for nonimperial—and anti-imperial—action.”<span class="citation" data-cites="williamsWhatThisCountry1970"><sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p>Exactly how Williams’s analysis would square Hoover’s acribed anti-imperialism with his relative indifference to the establishment of a Nazi empire in Europe and Africa remains unclear. As is often, if not invariably, the case with historians who seek to rehabilitate opponents of Roosevelt’s anti-Nazi foreign policy, Williams does not say what he thinks would have happened to those under Nazi rule, or to the United States, in an alternate history where Hoover remained the architect of US foreign policy.</p>
<p>Williams’s understanding of Hoover has long since been undermined by the contents of the archives, but that would have been all right by him:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For the feel of how Hoover reacted, do not waste your time ransacking the archives. Just listen to The Doors doing the first verse of “The Soft Parade.”<span class="citation" data-cites="williamsWhatThisCountry1970"><sup>7</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fear that much scholarly sympathy for the interwar isolationists is about as soundly supported.<sup>8</sup></p>

  <title>Making a chart on the fly</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/gdp_chart/gdp_chart.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I posted a map on social media recently that drew wholly from online resources; I’m trying to do this for all my charts and maps this quarter. There are practical reasons, having to do with not keeping large data files lying around; there are also principled reasons, having to do with reproducible research and adherence to community standards.</p>
<p>I learned to do this mainly by taking <a href="https://codehorizons.com/Seminars/data-wrangling-with-r/">Kieran Healy’s invaluable Data Wrangling and Data Visualization course, online.</a></p>
<p>I am, I hope, as sensitive as anyone to historians’ need to consult archival and arcane resources and I love the library as much as anyone. But if a reasonably authoritative chart or map for teaching can be made from community resources, it probably should be.</p>
<p>So here’s an example; I often like to show something like the comparative impact of the Great Depression. You could go to the library and look in <em>International Historical Statistics</em> and type information by hand into a spreadsheet—and I wouldn’t want to stop you. But you could also reach out and grab information from, let’s say, the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/?lang=en">Maddison Project at the University of Groningen.</a><sup>1</sup></p>

  <title>President Hoover was not a progressive</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/hoover/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>President Herbert Hoover was no progressive; the New Deal did not begin under his administration nor in a fantasy alternate history where he won reelection would he have implemented anything resembling a New Deal. You might think it unnecessary to say such things, given <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/#category=Election%20of%201932">the vituperation Hoover directed at the New Deal in the 1932 election,</a> or his record in office.<span class="citation" data-cites="rauchwayNewDealWas2019"><sup>1</sup></span> But there are a number of historians who argue President Hoover was kind of a proto-New Dealer, much misunderstood; to the contrary, he was well on the conservative side of his own party.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>This view is not unique to me, but is commonly held among people who have spent any amount of time with Hoover’s own papers. See for example Elliot A. Rosen:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a curious twist of subsequent American historiography, Hoover has since then been situated by some academicians as the originator of the interventionist state. Yet from the onset of his public career, his mission was to place curbs on the power of the central government. The claim that Hoover accepted deficit financing is a fiction, as it resulted from declining revenues and not from increased expenditure.<sup>3</sup> Equally fallacious is the claim that there existed no substantial differences in their monetary policies other than Roosevelt’s willingness to detach the dollar from gold, which distorts their fundamental differences on the subject of money and credit.<span class="citation" data-cites="rosen2014"><sup>4</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or consider William E. Leuchtenburg’s case.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He was not a weak president; rather, he acted forcefully to circumscribe the federal government. . . . When the Senate began to consider measures to stimulate the economy, he appeared in person in the chamber to upbraid the lawmakers. “We cannot legislate ourselves out of a world economic depression,” he declared in 1931. . . . He persisted in this course despite graphic evidence that the devastation of the Depression was deepening. . . . He set up sixty-two fact-finding groups to provide enlightenment on public issues, then refused to believe what the studies revealed. He even ignored the recommendations of his own appointee who told him that voluntarism was not working and that the federal government had to intercede. . . . The more hardship spread, the more determined Hoover was to turn a blind eye to it. . . . Hoover promoted policies that made a terrible situation even worse. Obsessive about balancing the budget, he sought to slash federal spending and raise taxes—exactly the wrong steps to take. . . .<span class="citation" data-cites="leuchtenburg2015"><sup>5</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe you can tell in both cases that the writers are irked by having to say these things; I think in part because their own early works were, and are, often cited to support the case they are here methodically refuting. Notably, Rosen had worked with Raymond Moley, who credited the Hoover administration with originating what <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/moley/index.html">the conservative Moley</a> later regarded as the good parts of the New Deal.<span class="citation" data-cites="moleyFirstNewDeal1966"><sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p>It’s worth highlighting Leuchtenburg’s point: <em>Hoover</em> steadfastly resisted policies that would look like the later New Deal, but that doesn’t mean people in his administration and his party didn’t propose them. Hoover opposed publicly owned and operated electricity, championed by Republican Senator George Norris of Nebraska. Hoover opposed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and, once it was created, limited its operation; it was the creature of his own Fed chair, Eugene Meyer. Hoover, as Leuchtenburg says, opposed the recommendations of his own commissions on unemployment, including the one headed by AT&amp;T CEO Walter Gifford. Hoover actively opposed or by indifference killed a lot of the more creative ideas his subordinates proposed. He declined to pursue the activist monetary policy Adolph Miller, the longest-serving member of the Federal Reserve, proposed to him—leaving Miller no choice to propose the same policy to the much more receptive Franklin Roosevelt.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Although in my view she concedes a bit too much to the “proto-New Dealer” party on the way to this point, I think Lisa McGirr gets Hoover right:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hoover’s federal activism foreshadowed a strand of neoliberalism that would take firm roots in the later twentieth century, a kind of conservatism comfortable with a more expansive state devoted primarily to conservative policy ends.<span class="citation" data-cites="mcgirrWarAlcoholProhibition2016"><sup>8</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prohibition, tariffs, immigration restriction and deportation were fine with Hoover; economic development, relief of unemployment, or activist monetary policy, not so much.</p>
<p>Why do people tend to say otherwise? This to me is the most frustrating question ever asked in a historiographical debate, the demand that you account for why other people are wrong. I will note that while Rosen cites “academicians,” one wing of the “Hoover, proto-New Dealer” faction is the decidedly non-academic group of conservative activists who want to blame the Great Depression on government intervention of any and all kinds.<span class="citation" data-cites="shlaes2007"><sup>9</sup></span> But another source—and, I think, the reason Leuchtenburg and Rosen’s earlier work is implicated in it—is the mid-century consensus historiography that sought to minimize and tame the political conflicts that characterized American history.</p>

<p>Kathy and I had a new article come out, “A New Deal for Wine,” in the <em>Journal of Policy History.</em><span class="citation" data-cites="olmstedNewDealWine2024"><sup>1</sup></span> Which provided the occasion for me to update my c.v.—it’s been linked in the top bar to this blog since I started it, but now it’s up to date and (I hope) free of errors.

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>As I <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/archives1/">mentioned,</a> we had some good research trips this summer, including one notably productive one to the National Archives, but we got great material at some less-obvious places too—like this one.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>The St.&nbsp;Croix Landmarks Society Archives on Estate Whim near Frederiksted.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The St.&nbsp;Croix Landmarks Society is a (rather wonderfully) volunteer-staffed operation in the pictured building, holding some intriguing collections on the history of the island and the US Virgin Islands generally.</p>
<p>Estate Whim itself is an old sugar plantation (some of which has been restored and made a museum of enslavement in St.&nbsp;Croix) which the US government bought in the waning days of the Hoover administration and parceled out and plowed for homesteads. As with many other Depression-fighting ideas floated in the Hoover administration, the homestead program was a moderately good one, came from people well down in the bureaucracy, was underfunded, and proceeded without haste despite urgent need owing to disinterest at the level of the cabinet and the White House. It took two years after Congress appropriated the money even to begin operations. The New Deal got it going in earnest, though.</p>
<p>It was also, on its own, going to be inadequate; Crucian farmers wouldn’t get very far growing sugar without a local market for their product,<sup>1</sup> and for that, they needed the Virgin Islands Company. An agency of the New Deal, the Virgin Islands Company provided a guaranteed purchaser for sugar grown on St.&nbsp;Croix (and made a bunch of it into rum, though that’s another story).</p>
<p>Anyway: the homestead program and the Virgin Islands Company were, as one administrator’s memo we found in the St.&nbsp;Croix Landmarks Society archives explained, “complementary” operations. By itself, the homestead program wasn’t going to get very far: with the guaranteed government purchaser, it provided substantial primary or supplementary income to small-scale farmers. Documents in the National Archives give good examples of the more than four hundred homesteaders—ninety percent of whom were Black Crucians; the rest were Puerto Ricans who had come to St.&nbsp;Croix at least two years before—who did well out of the program.<sup>2</sup></p>

  <title>An unnamed government agency, you say</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/archives1/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We had the good fortune to make several research trips this summer, including one to the National Archives at College Park (the big one). We’ve learned the pleasantest way to do it is to stay in College Park, rather than in Washington; much easier to get to and from, and perfectly lovely environment. And we found great material.</p>
<p>But it wouldn’t be an archival trip without a dry hole or two. There was an actually empty box (“that does happen,” the archivist says); a folder whose contents were temporarily removed for review, the slip says, on 6/8/71; and the one below.</p>

<p>So: Which government agency is studying the nitty-gritty work of the Works Progress Administration, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and other New Deal operations in Puerto Rico? If you know the answer, please say!</p>

  <title>Remember the women</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/women/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Ben Mathis-Lilley of Slate asked me if I would talk to him a bit about whether women voters brought progressivism to the United States (or, as some would say, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/jd-vance-women-weird-voting-peter-thiel.html">ruined the country</a>), so I said, “sure.”</p>
<p>Women voted much as men did, but in smaller numbers, up until 1980 or so—when men <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/ggpresvote.pdf">suddenly skewed far more conservative.</a> So really, the thing that needs explaining is why men voters should have proved so volatile, so emotional, so unpredictable when Ronald Reagan appeared on the scene.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean people don’t believe women have, and had, a special interest in voting certain ways, but that belief has varied over time. You might instinctively think that women would be more pro-welfare. The Republican congress and president who supported the Sheppard-Towner Act of 1921 probably did think that. Harriet Frothingham’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1923/02/17/archives/dismisses-suit-against-maternity-act.html">case</a> told them otherwise and the existence of vocal, politically active, conservative women probably helped ensure the Sheppard-Towner Act’s demise.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/women/dewsonflyer.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Excerpt from a women’s division flyer touting the proposed New Deal (or, as here, Square Deal) for labor.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In the 1932 election, the Democrats had a women’s division headed by Molly Dewson, whose team put out flyers that told voters about the New Deal—but she kept the women’s division name off them, to avoid prejudicing men who read them. Dewson believed there was no such thing as women’s issues per se, and warned Franklin Roosevelt, “Franklin, if you ever mortify me by making a speech specifically addressed to women I shall never forgive you.”<span class="citation" data-cites="dewsonAidEnd1952"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p>It was common to believe that women would vote for Herbert Hoover, though: he was supposed to have a rapport with them owing to his time as Food Administrator, as Mathis-Lilley notes. Henry Wallace wrote in mid-October, “The thing I am really afraid of in this election is the woman vote. I am afraid that it is too late to do anything about the women.”<span class="citation" data-cites="wallace1932"><sup>2</sup></span> Hoover aides thought similarly; one especially optimistic one wrote at the start of November, “It is still possible to carry California, the wonderful favorable reaction to Hoover’s speech and the unfavorable reaction to the Roosevelt speech, plus Shuler, plus the women, all will save the day here” (they didn’t).<span class="citation" data-cites="bush1932"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p>Molly Dewson was probably right in 1932 that women would consider the issues much as men did, though we don’t have sophisticated polling data to tell us so.</p>

</div>
<p>To get there, you go all the way out the East End Road, through land cleared during the New Deal by Civilian Conservation Corps workers. Local memory of this is pretty sound, though there’s no official memorial. There’s a “Coral Conservation Corps” plaque on a building at Cramer’s Park, a popular CCC-built beach (the men cleared it of brush and boar). The Coral Conservation Corps are a youth organization sponsored by local businesses; someone clearly had the original CCC in mind.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In February 1935 the Supreme Court was about to issue an opinion on the question of whether the Roosevelt administration’s policy of taking the country off the gold standard was constitutional.</p>
<p>On first coming into office Roosevelt ended the gold standard—people could no longer exchange a dollar for the statutory rate of $20.67 to an ounce of pure gold. By this measure Roosevelt meant to induce the expectation of inflation, and start money out of hoarding and into circulation. Over the course of 1933 the administration devalued the dollar by various means and early in 1934, using the authority of the new Gold Reserve Act, set the dollar at $35 to an ounce of gold, subject to change.</p>
<p>The administration viewed its policy of moving away from the gold standard and toward a managed dollar as an effective means of fighting the Depression and also of rallying other countries to recovery. Indeed, it proved effective, both economically and eventually as a tool to assemble an international coalition against fascism.<span class="citation" data-cites="rauchwayMoneyMakersHow2015 hausmanRecoveryGreatDepression2019 eggertssonGreatExpectationsEnd2008"><sup>1</sup></span> To reverse this policy in 1935 and return to the lower prices of 1932 would be calamitous economically, politically, and diplomatically.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and his advisors considered various options for getting around an adverse Court opinion; one idea the president floated was to have Federal Reserve branches honor the commitment to redeem paper money in gold at the teller window, but to forbid depositors from taking that gold out of the building, requiring them instead to exchange it for paper money if they wished to return it to circulation.</p>
<p>Roosevelt also prepared an address to give in the event of the Court demanding he reverse course. In it, he prepared to illustrate in concrete terms how dangerous such a policy would be, and to conclude,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They have decided these cases in accordance with the letter of the law as they saw it. It is nevertheless my duty to protect the people of the United States to the best of my ability. To carry through the decision of the Court to its logical and inescapable end will so endanger the people of this Nation that I am compelled to look beyond the letter of the law to <a href="http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/msf/msf00790">the spirit.”</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He promised further messages and actions to that end in the coming days.</p>
<p>He never had to give the speech; the Court left this policy—unlike many others—intact. But he meant to fight the Court if he had to.</p>

  <title>He reads to us from something called ‘Ulysses’</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/03/26/comstock-act-supreme-court-abortion-pill/">Justices Thomas and Alito have brought the Comstock laws back into the news</a> in an effort to craft a national ban on abortion. The laws banned a lot more, including James Joyce’s masterpiece <em>Ulysses,</em> until the dawn of the New Deal.</p>
<p>On March 3, 1873, Congress substantially expanded section 148 of the existing statute defining the scope and activities of the Post Office. The law already banned any “obscene book, pamphlet, picture, print, or other publication of a vulgar or indecent character” from the mails and defined sending such stuff as a misdemeanor for which a perpetrator could be fined not more than $500 and serve not more than a year in prison.<sup>1</sup> Now they went much further:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>no obscene, lewd, or lascivious book, pamphlet, picture, paper, print, or other publication of an indecent character, or any article or thing designed for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion, nor any article or thing intended or adapted for any indecent or immoral use or nature, nor any written or printed card, circular, book, pamphlet, advertisement or notice of any kind gfiving information, directly or indirectly, where, or how, or of whom, or by what means either of the things before mentioned may be obtained or made</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—nothing like that could go in the mails, and anyone convicted of doing it could be fined not less than $100 and not more than $5000 or imprisoned not less than a year or more than ten years, or both.<sup>2</sup> Forty years later, in 1913, this statute and its revisions were summarized in the Post Office’s regulations as below, prohibiting anything “filthy”; the penalty was now not more than $5000 in fines and not more than 5 years in prison.</p>
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/comstockery/po_com.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>That’s what the New York postmaster, Thomas Patten, cited in 1919 when asking Judge W.H. Lamar, solicitor of the Post Office, what he thought of the May 1919 issue of the <em>Little Review,</em> which contained the “Scylla and Charybdis” episode of James Joyce’s yet unfinished novel <em>Ulysses.</em> Lamar found it “unmailable.” The Post Office found the same of the issue containing the “Cyclops” episode, for political reasons possibly relating to the Espionage Act passed during the Great War; the nation was now fully into the red scare.<span class="citation" data-cites="weirWhatDidHe2000"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p>But it was in 1920 when the real Comstockery came: Anthony Comstock’s successor as head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, John Sumner, lodged a complaint against the <em>Little Review</em> for publishing the “Nausicaa” episode, which includes a scene—obscured, to be sure, under literary prose—of Leopold Bloom masturbating while looking at Gerty MacDowell on the beach. At trial, a three-judge panel found the publishers of the <em>Little Review,</em> Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap, guilty. As Anderson wrote,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They “don’t care who James Joyce is or whether he has written the finest books in the world”; their only function is to decide whether certain passages of “Ulysses” (Incidentally the only passages they can understand) violate the statute. . . . This decision establishes us as criminals and we are led to an adjoining building where another bewildered official takes our fingerprints!!!<span class="citation" data-cites="andersonUlyssesCourt1921"><sup>4</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key point there is that the judges confined themselves to the question of whether the particular passage should be understood as “filthy.”</p>
<p>In 1933, when <em>Ulysses</em> came once more to court, Judge John Woolsey of the Southern District of New York had the whole book.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have read “Ulysses” once in its entirety and I have read the passages of which the government particularly complains several times. . . . “Ulysses” is not an easy book to read or to understand. But there has been much written about it, and in order properly to approach the consideration of it it is advisable to read a number of other books which have now become its satellites. The study of “Ulysses” is, therefore, a heavy task.<sup>5</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judge Woolsey had previously established himself as a dedicated scholar; in holding that the book <em>Married Love</em> was not obscene, he mentioned he derived necessary perspective from reading Havelock Ellis.<sup>6</sup> He was also a pretty good literary critic.<span class="citation" data-cites="vanderhamLiftingBanUlysses1994"><sup>7</sup></span></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Joyce has attempted—it seems to me, with astonishing success—to show how the screen of consciousness with its ever-shifting kaleidoscopic impressions carries, as it were on a plastic palimpsest, not only what is in the focus of each man’s observation of the actual things about him, but also in a penumbral zone residua of past impressions, some recent and some drawn up by association from the domain of the subconscious. He shows how each of these impressions affects the life and behavior of the character which he is describing. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If Joyce did not attempt to be honest in developing the technique which he has adopted in “Ulysses,” the result would be psychologically misleading and thus unfaithful to his chosen technique. Such an attitude would be artistically inexcusable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is because Joyce has been loyal to his technique and has not funked its necessary implications, but has honestly attempted to tell fully what his characters think about, that he has been the subject of so many attacks. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short: people think about sex. Sometimes quite a lot. So portraying it—along with the many, many other things Joyce portrays in <em>Ulysses</em>—is true to the book’s purpose.</p>
<p>Woolsey wasn’t above being a little funny.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>My considered opinion is, after long reflection, is that, whilst in many places the effect of “Ulysses” on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering the entire book, rather than the allegedly offending passage, was an important shift in the law on obscenity.<span class="citation" data-cites="gillersTendencyDepraveCorrupt2007"><sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p>So <em>Ulysses</em> could come into the United States. And so, as Morris Ernst, the attorney for Random House, wrote in the foreword to US edition of <em>Ulysses,</em> “The New Deal in the law of letters is here.”<span class="citation" data-cites="joyceUlysses1961"><sup>9</sup></span></p>

  <title>Not a review of Masters of the Air</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/air/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This is not a review of <em>Masters of the Air;</em> I’m not a tv critic and in the end I mainly enjoyed it for what it was—this is instead a discussion of what it’s not: a story of the US bomber war in Europe, which I think could still be dramatized someday.</p>
<p>The basic, traditional history of the US bomber war in Europe has a clear dramatic arc. It starts with high hopes; these are swiftly tempered by cruel realities; in the end much is gained though much also is lost, and at the close of it, one would be hard-pressed to say that the right lessons are learned or that the just will prosper while the unjust receive their comeuppance. That’s a narrative with which a talented dramatist could keep an audience, I think.</p>
<p>We could put a few concrete details on that narrative line:</p>
<p>It began with the idea of precision strikes at the means of making war by bombers capable of self-defense tasked with achieving, to pick a phrase, <a href="https://archive.org/details/VictoryThroughAirPower">“victory through air power.”</a></p>
<p>That idea is what sent US air crews and factory-fresh B-24s to the North African desert in 1942, with the intention of striking at the vitals of the German war machine—the oil refineries in Romania. This little raid inspired the local Luftwaffe colonel to observe, “This is the beginning.” The Germans, recognizing what would come next, prepared. Subsequent raids on the oil refineries by North Africa-based B-24s incurred heavy US losses—some 280 aircraft and some 2,800 airmen.</p>
<p>That pattern, of striking at industrial targets with the idea of crushing the factories that made modern war possible, and finding out that German defenses could destroy more bombers than the Americans could afford to lose, persisted. Moreover, precision bombing—as the RAF already knew—was a fantasy. The much-celebrated Norden bombsight could, maybe, deliver precision over the sunny US southwest, where many pilots trained—bombs into pickle barrels from thousands of feet in the air!—but it was a very different thing over cloudy and fighter-infested northern and central Europe.</p>
<p>The bombing campaign in 1942–43 (I am reasonably persuaded by modern historians like Phillips O’Brien) may have achieved more than conventional wisdom allows.<span class="citation" data-cites="obrienHowWarWas2015"><sup>1</sup></span> But those gains came at unsustainable costs: the US couldn’t afford to lose so many trained pilots and crews.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the advances of fighter technology (increased range for P-47s and the arrival of P-51s) as well as advances of the Allies into Western Europe that allowed a free range of bombing in Germany and German-held territory. And the campaigns of early 1944 helped pave the way for D-Day.</p>
<p>In the end the bombing campaign became more what the RAF leaders, particularly Arthur Harris, always insisted it had to be: a parallel to and would-be replacement for the ground war, an attempt to pummel the Germans into surrender. The destruction of Dresden in February 1945 stuck out in the minds even of some airmen at the time as exceptionally brutal—though that feeling was swiftly muddied by news out of the liberated concentration camps, and a renewed feeling (for some people, anyway) that the savagery had to be stopped, even if by savage means.</p>
<p>Whatever the justice of that sentiment, its essence (“we did terrible things that had to be done”) was a long way from the (literally) Disneyfied original vision of the bomber war.</p>
<p>Anyway: that’s the narrative of the US bomber war which I kind of wanted to see dramatized. It’s not exactly <em>not</em> in <em>Masters of the Air,</em> but nor is it foregrounded; the series is really the story of a few guys who were among the last out of Stalag Luft III and, for the sake of perspective, a couple of their luckier squadron members. Which is fine, that’s a real story. And you get to see some B-17s and P-51s, and some of the misery and horror of aerial combat.</p>
<p>But though some of those narrative beats I outlined above do appear in the series, they do so only fleetingly. Indeed, owing to the focus on the pilots who were shot down, the air war itself largely vanishes from the narrative. I wanted to see some discussion of Hamburg, Caen, Dresden, the bombing of the IG Farben site at Auschwitz-Birkenau; they’re not here.</p>
<p>As I say, this is <em>not</em> a review of <em>Masters of the Air,</em> because it would be annoying if it were. But I did want to sketch quickly a story of the bomber war that could be dramatized.</p>
<p>And because I just have to, here’s a chart that shows why I’d like to see some airplanes that aren’t B-17s or P-51s.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>As previously <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/greer_3_dog/index.html">noted,</a> Admiral Harold “Betty” Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, wrote the “Plan Dog” memo on November 12, 1940, advocating a joint US-UK naval strategy against Germany in the Atlantic. The president invited the British to come to Washington for joint staff conversations on December 2, 1940.<span class="citation" data-cites="connWesternHemisphereFramework1960"><sup>1</sup></span> But before that—on November 28—Stark, as Chief of Naval Operations, issued an order to ensure practical preparedness for Anglo-American cooperation: he asked the New York Navy Yard to manufacture twenty sets of Royal Navy signal flags, for use by US warships needing to communicate with their British counterparts.<span class="citation" data-cites="chiefofnavaloperations1941"><sup>2</sup></span></p>

<figcaption>Part of the Royal Navy signal card for 1937.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The US navy and the British navy used different sets of signal flags, so for an American destroyer, say, to communicate with its British counterpart would require the use of a common language.<span class="citation" data-cites="unitedstatesnavyBluejacketsManual1940 SignalCard1937"><sup>3</sup></span> Stark decided therefore that US ships should be issued with sets of British flags and pennants, and extra fabric to repair them. In February 1941, after the staff conferences, Stark increased the order from twenty to one hundred, fifty to be stored in New York and fifty in Norfolk, for issue to ships on the Atlantic squadron.<span class="citation" data-cites="chiefofnavaloperations1941"><sup>4</sup></span> By April they were available for distribution; on May 6, the USS <em>Greer</em> received its set from the supply ship USS <em>Prairie.</em><span class="citation" data-cites="supplyofficerussprairieInvoice41 commandantnorfolknavyyard1941"><sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p>The president had long since articulated <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/panama/index.html">a vision of hemispheric defense,</a> which would involve de facto assistance to Britain. On February 27, 1941—in, as it happens, a speech to the Oscars—he reminded listeners of this hemispheric policy and made explicit the implicit link to a broader defense:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the defense of all the democracies of all the Americas . . . involves the future of democracy wherever it is imperiled by force or terror.<span class="citation" data-cites="rooseveltAddressAnnualAwards1950"><sup>6</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In March, Lend Lease passed Congress; on April 25, the administration declared the “patrol” being conducted by US Navy ships looking for aggressor activity would be extended, though Roosevelt said the United States was still not, per se, <a href="http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/pc/pc0116.pdf">conducting convoys.</a> But:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Q Mr.&nbsp;President, if this patrol should encounter some apparently aggressive ships headed toward the western hemisphere, what would it do about it?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me know. (loud laughter)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, perhaps, use its new signal flags to communicate the presence of a German vessel to the Royal Navy. Three weeks after the <em>Greer</em> received its set of British signal flags, the president declared an unlimited national emergency, in which the naval patrol would play a vital part.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>These ships and planes warn of the presence of attacking raiders, on the sea, under the sea, and above the sea. The danger from these raiders is, of course, greatly lessened if their location is definitely known. . . . Our patrols are helping now to insure delivery of the needed supplies to Britain. All additional measures necessary to deliver the goods will be taken.<span class="citation" data-cites="rooseveltRadioAddressAnnouncing1950"><sup>7</sup></span></p>

  <title>Panic and confidence</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/wigmore/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Barrie A. Wigmore has an article of 1987 asking whether the gold panic of early 1933 was caused by fears of devaluation, to which he answers “yes.”<span class="citation" data-cites="wigmoreWasBankHoliday1987"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p>But immediately on taking office, Roosevelt began the process of devaluing, and the panic ended. Here’s Wigmore’s own data of daily gold holdings in the New York Federal Reserve Bank, charted.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/wigmore/wigmore_gold.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Chart showing the NY Fed’s gold holdings falling before Roosevelt’s inauguration, then immediately rebounding.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Wigmore’s argument is that Roosevelt’s immediate actions might have done something to restore confidence, but not much.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is no doubt that his inaugural speech, his fireside chat about the banking system, the various measures he rushed through Congress, and his general ability to take command had a very favorable impact on confidence. Measurement of this impact is highly subjective, but intuitively it cannot be a large part of the explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet depositors brought much of the gold they had withdrawn back to Federal Reserve banks over the course of March—before Roosevelt’s April 5 order requiring them to do it. Indeed, as you can see from the chart, the steepest rise in gold holdings comes between the inauguration and the fireside chat.</p>
<p>During that time, in his first presidential press conference, on March 8, 1933, Roosevelt allowed as how, according to a definition of the gold standard he pulled from the newspaper, the United States wasn’t on it at the moment, shied away from the term “controlled inflation,” and then almost immediately said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What you are coming to now really is a managed currency, the adequateness of which will depend on the conditions of the moment. It may expand one week and it may contract another week. That part is all off the record.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A reporter asked if they could print “that part—managed?” Roosevelt replied, “No, I think not.” A little later a reporter pressed him further on what he meant.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Q When you speak of a managed currency, do you speak of a temporary proposition or a permanent system?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>THE PRESIDENT: It ought to be part of the permanent system—that is off the record—it ought to be part of the permanent system so we don’t run into this thing again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two days later, when he announced the plan for reopening banks, he noted this would include all usual banking functions—</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Except, of course, for as to gold. That is a different thing. I am keeping my finger on gold.</p>

<p>These press conferences are now online <a href="http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/pc/pc0183.pdf">here</a> as they were not when I was writing <em>The Money Makers,</em> in which I discuss this period.<span class="citation" data-cites="rauchwayMoneyMakersHow2015"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>In any case, it looks as though Roosevelt was certainly letting the information get out, albeit off the record, that he wanted a permanent system of managed currency and that he wasn’t allowing gold convertibility—and yet, during that time, depositors brought an awful lot of gold back into the Federal Reserve banks. It seems to me that confidence in the new administration’s actions—the first stages of a devaluation—restored some confidence even though they constituted precisely what people were supposed to have feared.</p>

<p>While doing a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/187kiyq/hello_im_eric_rauchway_a_historian_of_the_new/?rdt=53843">Reddit AMA for <em>Myth America,</em></a> in which I have a chapter on pernicious myths about the New Deal, I received <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/187kiyq/comment/kbfqmwp/">a question about <em>Murdering McKinley,</em></a> reminding me that book is twenty years old this year.<span class="citation" data-cites="rauchwayNewDeal2022 rauchwayMurderingMcKinleyMaking2003"><sup>1</sup></span> A quick glance at <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/erauchway/cv_pub/blob/main/rauchway_cv.html">my c.v.</a> told me that by a coincidence of timing, that means <em>The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Very Short Introduction</em> is fifteen years old, and <em>Winter War: Hoover, Roosevelt, and the First Clash over the New Deal</em> is five.<span class="citation" data-cites="rauchwayGreatDepressionNew2008 rauchwayWinterWarHoover2018"><sup>2</sup></span> These arbitrary digital anniversaries don’t mean a thing, except that we make them so, which is no reason not to. So here are some thoughts, which are mainly for me before I forget them.</p>

<p>First, these are easily the three most popular of my books. That popularity owes to different causes. The VSI is in a well known series with a good reputation. The VSI and <em>Winter War</em> happened to appear shortly before moments when their topics seemed relevant (<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95737884">the Great Economic Unpleasantness of the late Bush administration</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21563753/2020-election-trump-biden-transition-fdr-hoover">the Trump–Biden transition,</a> respectively). <em>Murdering McKinley</em> hadn’t either of those advantages, but Brian Lamb did like it for <a href="https://booknotes.org/Watch/177827-1/Eric-Rauchway">Booknotes.</a></p>
<p>All three of them came out of definite ideas that then changed in significantly in the process of researching and writing, though for different reasons.</p>
<p><em>Murdering McKinley</em> started out of my sense that the transition from McKinley to Theodore Roosevelt was much more consequential than then-current historiography supposed, and the willingness of Thomas LeBien, then an editor at Hill and Wang, to believe I could write it relatively quickly and well. With my reading of the Vernon Briggs papers in the Massachusetts Historical Society, the book morphed into a kind of social scientific detective story. For the most part the narrative looks over Briggs’s shoulder as he tries to figure out Czolgosz’s motives. Owing to the amorphous state of psychiatry at the time, Briggs looked into a wide range of possibilities, and his investigation of Czolgosz took him in turn into almost every troubled corner of American life at around 1900. Everywhere he looked he could see motives, which in the end meant he couldn’t know what <em>the</em> motive was: almost every way you could say Czolgosz had suffered, so had millions of other Americans—but he was the one who pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>I remain reasonably happy with the book although if I had it to do again I would give more attention to foreign policy. Czolgosz did at one point indicate dissatisfaction with the hypocrisy of US colonization of the Philippines (among the many other aspects of American society with which he was unhappy), and given that the book came out just as the Iraq War was beginning, it would have been a useful time for historical reflection on that episode.</p>
<p>The <em>Very Short Introduction</em> came about because Oxford University Press editor Susan Ferber asked me if I’d like to do a VSI on the Great Depression. I had just done <em>Blessed Among Nations</em> which, with <em>Murdering McKinley,</em> established that I was willing to write about matters like the tariff and the gold standard and the mess left of the US economy after the Great War. Susan must have thought that caring about all that stuff was a good qualification for writing about the slump of 1929–1933, even if I hadn’t yet written directly about that period. I wanted to do it because I was then thinking about writing a book that would end with the 1930s, so it would be useful to me.</p>
<p>The VSI series was already well established in the British headquarters of OUP, but this was going to be one of the first volumes commissioned by the US office, and there was some uncertainty about format—whether it would have scholarly apparatus, and so forth—but the key thing was, it would be Very Short, as the titles indicate. There was a strict word count, which I don’t remember, but it was small; nevertheless I had barely thought about it before I went back to Susan and said I wanted it to cover the New Deal as well as the Great Depression. She said yes: as long as I stuck within the word count.</p>
<p>The book reflects the state of historiography at the time and I would certainly write it differently if I could write it now. But maybe then it wouldn’t be as popular. I was determined to integrate as much of the history of the New Deal done in departments of economics as I could with the history done in departments of history, and that led to a book that did indeed have perhaps more to say about tariffs and the gold standard and public works policies than most. It reflects the good work done by then-beginning historians of the New Deal, like Andrew W. Cohen, Meg Jacobs, and Jason Scott Smith.</p>
<p>It also reflects the interpretations of the two major New Deal historians of the 1990s, Alan Brinkley and David M. Kennedy. And while including Brinkley’s observations about the broader possibilities of the 1930s, and Kennedy’s insistence on the continuity between the New Deal and the war, I wanted to go a bit further in crediting the New Deal itself; so much of the literature aimed at what it <em>hadn’t</em> done. So my contribution, I thought, was to emphasize—and expand a bit—John Kenneth Galbraith’s concept of countervailing power. The New Deal not only supported labor unions, but also workers, consumers, and farmers more broadly, as well as ill developed regions like the South and the intermountain West, and so forth, in rebalancing unbalanced markets; that was more than security—that was a lasting structural effect.</p>
<p>I got some comments about the VSI from established New Deal historians, who said various versions of “I couldn’t have written about it that succinctly,” which I chose to take as a compliment.</p>
<p>I also thought I should keep Franklin D. Roosevelt out of it as much as possible. I was not—and still don’t think I am—a presidential historian, and I understood the New Deal (like Progressivism) to result from much broader forces than the election of a single person. Still, those elections and those persons matter in funneling or focusing those factors. So you’ve got to talk about presidents and presidencies, even if you don’t want them to dominate the narrative unduly. Roosevelt scarcely appears in the VSI as a force in himself until the last chapter, which I think is probably a good way at least to begin thinking about the New Deal—as a product of long-pent forces released and given focus by his election, rather than the product of the Roosevelt White House per se—though ultimately one does have to reckon with him, just as Americans at the time did.</p>
<p>That need to reckon with what Roosevelt did, and didn’t, do led to <em>Winter War.</em> I worked on it with Lara Heimert at Basic Books, who had also edited my previous book, <em>The Money Makers,</em> about Roosevelt’s repeated reliance on monetary policy from 1933–1945. In the course of writing that book I became persuaded that, contrary to a lot of commentary, Roosevelt had a clear agenda going into November 1932 and that his actions between election and inauguration had to do with protecting and furthering that agenda. As with <em>Murdering McKinley,</em> I made a good archival find that enabled greater insight into Roosevelt’s campaign and embryonic administration. During some research at the Hoover Institution, I found some correspondence of Robert Jackson—not the later Supreme Court justice and Nuremberg prosecutor, but the political operator—in which Jackson mentioned his diary; I was able pretty easily to find the diary was archived at his alma mater, Dartmouth. And it contained some terrific material on how the campaign functioned, and what it was like to work with Roosevelt and his inner circle. Using that and the diaries of some Hoover aides—Edgar Rickard, Theodore Joslin, James MacLafferty—as well as that of Raymond Moley’s secretary, Celeste Jedel, I had a pretty good picture of the Democratic and Republican camps.</p>
<p>Roosevelt liked to compare himself to a football quarterback: he knew where he needed to go, and the rules for getting there, but whether he might pass, hand off, or run the ball himself remained open, and he liked to keep his options open until the last possible second. It seemed to me an apt comparison, in its emphasis on shifting tactics and even strategy, but clear ultimate aims.<sup>3</sup> He viewed the New Deal as a program to reinvigorate and improve democracy in the United States—reinvigorating and improving the economy was a first step in that direction, and it had to be done in a way that was broadly beneficial if people were to begin to trust Washington, DC, again. And from the start, he and his aides saw the New Deal in the context of a world where democracy was under threat; as Jackson wrote just before Roosevelt took office,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The world situation is no better than here in the United States. The Japs are attacking China. In Germany. . . . the upstart Hitler, the rabble-rouser … is now Chancellor and demanding powers that will make him a dictator. . . . Such is the chaos that confronts Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got some nice feedback from established Roosevelt biographers, and some historians seem to feel it helped them reconceptualize the New Deal and the administration’s relationship to its constituencies, which is gratifying. I hope it continues to appeal to students of the New Deal. It certainly informed how I wrote about the New Deal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/opinion/fdr-new-deal.html">in my next book</a>—but <em>Why the New Deal Matters</em> doesn’t have a neat anniversary this year, so I’ll have to reflect on it another time.</p>
