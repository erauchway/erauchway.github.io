<p>The FDR Library has this photo, captioned, “The Last of the Royalty of Hawaii! Salutes the President—26 July 1934,” <a href="https://fdr.blogs.archives.gov/hawaii1-2/">on its website.</a></p>

<p>I’m pretty sure—especially from the description in the US Navy Historical Command’s <a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/h/houston-ii.html">history of the <em>USS Houston</em></a>—that the caption, written on the original photo, is intentionally whimsical, and the person wearing the feathered cape and headdress of Hawaiian aliʻi (familiar to viewers of <em>Chief of War</em>) is actually Duke Kahanamoku, Olympic swimming champion, longboard surfer, and then-serving sheriff of Honolulu. Duke Kahanamoku would also greet Ernest Gruening, as administrator of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions, in 1937—though apparently without the special garb.</p>
<p>Roosevelt’s 1934 trip was a combined Good Neighbor Policy / Territorial relations tour. He would first visit Haiti, from which <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015049924361?urlappend=%3Bseq=409%3Bownerid=13510798884175400-409">he had ordered the accelerated end</a> of the US occupation (reversing not only US policy but his own earlier views, when he was Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Wilson); he would also go to Colombia.</p>
<p>Maybe more importantly, he visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and afterward Hawaiʻi (the first sitting president to do so). He had just created the Division of Territories and Island Possessions to administer the New Deal in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hawaiʻi, and Alaska—the territories whose people were US citizens—and on this trip he would explain that US citizens in the territories were as much a part of the “American family” as anyone else.<span class="citation" data-cites="frankind.Radio1934 PresidentStCroix1934 franklindRadio1934-07-28"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

  <title>Unconditional Surrender</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/USgrant/usgrant.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>On January 24, 1943, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill held a joint press conference in Morocco, after some days discussing combined Allied strategy in the Casablanca meeting. (Stalin declined to attend.) They met there—they could meet there—because the US army had begun to assist the British army in clearing the Nazis from North Africa.</p>
<p>The most important immediate result of the conference was probably the plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive, but the more important in terms of strategy—and one that was very much, like the “United Nations,” like the prioritization of North Africa, Roosevelt’s personal preference—was the announcement of an Allied policy to demand unconditional surrender.</p>

</div>
<p>Roosevelt believed peace could only come with the utter defeat of the fascist powers. Not the destruction of their people, as he was quick to stipulate: but the destruction of their ability to make war. For him, the war was, necessarily, a war against fascism, not merely against a particular enemy, and fascism needed to be not only defeated but widely seen to have been defeated.</p>
<p>The demand for unconditional surrender was, and remains, debated in its wisdom. As Marc Gallicchio’s <em>Unconditional</em> establishes quite clearly, though, it was the New Dealers’ position; people on the political right—the pre-war isolationists, chiefly—were the ones who preferred an accommodation with the fascist powers.<span class="citation" data-cites="gallicchioUnconditionalJapaneseSurrender2020"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

  <title>Beginning a Planned Program</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/concepts_plan/concepts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>On April 7, 1932, while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a radio speech laying out “a few essentials, a beginning, in fact, of a planned program” of economic recovery; what you might call the basic concepts of a plan.</p>
<p>First, he said, the plan needed to run “bottom to top and not from top to bottom”—in contrast to the recently created Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which put some billions of dollars “at the disposal of the big banks, the railroads and the corporations of the nation.”</p>
<p>He said that even a large emergency public works program “would be only a stopgap,” and said that really what the nation needed was a “cure.”</p>
<p>He then sketched three basic ideas: pushing up the prices of farm commodities “to restore purchasing power to the farming half of the country”; protection for homeowners from foreclosure by protecting the smaller banks and lending companies; lowering tariffs “on the basis of a reciprocal exchange” with other countries.</p>
<p>He said these would be “only a part of ten or a dozen vital factors.” But that “temporary relief from the top down” would not suffice; the nation needed “permanent relief from the bottom up.”<span class="citation" data-cites="rooseveltAlbany1932-04-08"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> editorial board were shocked at this “demagogic claptrap.” The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was “conceived by the best financial and business brains of this country.” As for the smaller banks, “the closing of these little local banks has been stayed and almost stopped.” It had not, of course, been stopped on what the governor would have called a “permanent” basis and would resume and accelerate later in the summer.<span class="citation" data-cites="BottomManApril"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>Roosevelt enjoyed “the howl from the New York Times and other leading papers,”<span class="citation" data-cites="roosevelt1932-04-12"><sup>3</sup></span> as he wrote to Josephus Daniels, who had been his boss in the Navy Department. For his part, Daniels said, “you hit the bullseye”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We cannot win by letting the folks think the Republican party is 51% bad and we are only 49% bad. Some of our folks in Washington have thought if we acted not quite as subservient to the big interests as the Republicans we could win. You have shown that we must have a definite policy and that prosperity cannot be invoked by incantations and lending money to people who do not use it to start the wheels of industry.<span class="citation" data-cites="daniels1932-04-09"><sup>4</sup></span></p>

</div>
<p>Roosevelt would come to emphasize a large program of public works more, later in the campaign; at one point he would say that his proposed reforestation program alone—the idea that became the Civilian Conservation Corps—might employ a million workers.<span class="citation" data-cites="rooseveltChicago1932-07-02"><sup>5</sup></span> And he would continue to campaign on the ideas of propping up farm prices, lowering tariffs, and protecting the smaller lenders and borrowers.</p>

  <title>Rapid Involuntary Retirement</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/stewart/stewart_sacked.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Shortly after the chief of the Bureau of Labor Statistics declined to support a factually insupportable rosy jobs report, the president had him forcibly retired. In 1932, labor statistics commissioner Ethelbert Stewart was indignantly reclassified as dispensable.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have a contract with the Government and it has been broken. Retired? Don’t put it that way. I’ve had a tin can tied to the end of my coat tail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had very recently been yelled at by Secretary of Labor William Doak in front of reporters for <a href="https://time.com/archive/6749502/the-cabinet-tin-can/">disputing a bright employment forecast.</a></p>

  <title>Relief in the Territories, 1933</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/relief_pc/relief_st_terr.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1933, <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=48&amp;page=55">48 Stat. 56,</a> proposed to relieve “hardship and suffering caused by unemployment” in the United States, which meant not only the States and the District of Columbia, but the Territories, as the title and the first section of the law stated. The people of the United States in the Territories were also entitled to relief from the Depression, in keeping with Roosevelt’s broadly inclusive message about the interdependence of all the sprawling republic’s people.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="./pc_relief.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Per capita relief in states and territories.

<figcaption>Per capita relief in states and territories. Click to enlarge.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As you can see in the chart, relief went to the territories (shown in orange) on a basis commensurate with that of the states. While I’m skeptical of drawing any substantial inference based on the relative position of localities in the per-capita expenditures of the New Deal, the fact that the territories are in the same general run of per-capita spending as the states, and not outliers, suggests to me the early relief programs in the territories were comparable to those in the states. At least, for these four territories: these were the ones whose people were, by law, US citizens.</p>

  <title>Historians and the Isolationists: National Security</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/preston/tls_liberty.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/williams_hoover/williams_hoover.html">said</a> here <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/polling_ww2/polling_ww2.html">before</a> that I think scholars of US foreign relations give too much credence to isolationist arguments and now I guess I’ve said it <a href="https://www.the-tls.com/history/twentieth-century-onwards-history/total-defense-andrew-preston-book-review-eric-rauchway">in the <em>TLS,</em> too.</a></p>

<figcaption>Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill fishing. FDR Library.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I structured the essay around implications of the Roosevelt–Churchill destroyers-for-bases deal of 1940, and in discussing Andrew Preston’s <em>Total Defense,</em> which lays out the case that Roosevelt invented a modern discourse of “national security” that defined threats to the United States more broadly than ever before—indeed, globally and ideologically—I suggest we might not want to accept the arguments of those like Herbert Hoover and Charles Lindbergh that the Axis posed no threat to the United States itself.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>when Preston says that “geopolitical logic came down on the side of anti-interventionists like Hoover and Lindbergh: the United States was actually never in danger of being attacked by the Axis powers”, he is accepting implicitly their narrow definition of “the United States” – one that excluded the people of the US territories, many of whom were US citizens or nationals. It is perhaps understandable that Lindbergh, who was never known for his analytical acuity, should have left such people out of his geopolitical logic; for Roosevelt to do so would probably have violated his oath of office as president. Eventually, most of the US territories listed above did come under Axis attack and even occupation. If Roosevelt defined US national security with unprecedented breadth, then his opponents defined the defensible US so narrowly that they proposed to cede parts of the US to fascist invaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s more in that vein there, though I didn’t get into the nitty-gritty of it: the people in the US territories of Alaska, Hawaiʻi, and Puerto Rico were all defined by law as US citizens. All these places came under Axis attack during the war.<sup>1</sup> US citizens on Howland Island were <a href="https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1705/background/jarvis/welcome.html">killed by Japanese attack.</a> There are of course excellent cases that these lands and people ought not to have been under US government, but they were; and I suppose the morality or legality of US sovereignty over them, however dubious, would not have been notably improved by leaving them to the mercy of the Axis powers.</p>

  <title>DRINK TAROCO</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Part of the <a href="https://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/event/empire-of-the-new-deal">empire of the New Deal</a> was finding sustainable businesses to run in the US territories. Hawaiʻi grew lots of taro (kalo); why not find a market for it? The Department of the Interior ordered taro flour and a drink called Taroco in quantity, to be served in the department’s cafeteria.<span class="citation" data-cites="USOfficialsTaro1938-03-19"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p>Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes was photographed drinking Taroco and eating taro-flour biscuits in March 1938. Sadly, it was only about seven months before the project’s promoters reported to director of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions that “Taro products are having a hard time getting started.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ErnestGrueningdiary"><sup>2</sup></span> Before long the company gave up and sold its assets to another firm that made similar products for local manufacture.<span class="citation" data-cites="rada1952-12"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p>For what it’s worth, we’ve had taro-flour biscuits; they were pretty tasty. Never had chocolate taro milk though.</p>

  <title>Pitt Rivers and Totem Bight</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The TLS has <a href="https://www.the-tls.com/politics-society/social-cultural-studies/every-monument-will-fall-dan-hicks-book-review-tristram-hunt">a fairly bracing essay</a> by Tristram Hunt, curator of the V&amp;A, on a book by Dan Hicks, curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, an institution which Hunt describes (in my view aptly) as “a darkened labyrinth of cabinets” arranged in a “riotously Victorian, deliriously Gormenghast manner.” Adorning the essay is a photo like this one which gives a hint of the jumble that is the Pitt Rivers’s main hall, presided over by the tall Haida totem pole you can see near center, which once stood outside Star House in Massett Village in what is now Canada.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>Hicks, according to Hunt anyway, cordially loathes the collection of which he is curator, which perhaps accounts for the ambivalence on some of the explanatory plaques, like the one for that Haida totem, which asserts its figures and stories remain “part of Haida culture.”</p>
<p>As it happens a couple weeks ago Kathy Olmsted and I were on a research trip, mainly to go to archives, but also to see some other Haida, and Tlingit and Tsimshian, totem poles together with a clan house not unlike Star House, in Saxman Village near Ketchikan, Alaska. Together with Totem Bight, also near Ketchikan, and some other totem poles in town, these sites are the legacy of a New Deal program to, as one of its creators wrote, “see that these totems are preserved <em>in situ.</em>”</p>

<p>Under the New Deal, the federal government hired Native carvers to practice and pass on their art, which had fallen out of favor under missionary influence. The explanatory plaques there, unlike the one in the Pitt Rivers, do not assert that the totem poles and their figures and stories remain part of Native culture but perhaps that is because it is obvious; there Native people retain stewardship of the living art.</p>
<p>It is of course true that the Roosevelt reform program in the territories constituted an <a href="https://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/event/empire-of-the-new-deal">empire of the New Deal.</a> Does it matter that this empire, instead of carting cultural artifacts away to the Pitt Rivers, funded the preservation and perpetuation of the artifacts and moreover the art form amongst the people to whom it belonged?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The AHA hosted a Congressional briefing this morning in the Rayburn office building with about 70 people in attendance and a panel including Douglas Irwin, Sharon Ann Murphy, and me. C-SPAN filmed it for later broadcast. My remarks as prepared appear below, though if you should someday watch the C-SPAN recording you’ll know I went off script, based on what Doug had already said.</p>
<hr>
<p>Good morning. I’m going to speak for a few minutes on the origins of presidential authority to make tariff deals with other countries in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.</p>
<p>Franklin Roosevelt first ran for president in 1932 arguing for lower tariffs as part of the New Deal by saying the <strong>“outrageously excessive [tariff] rates . . . must come down. . . . by consenting to reduce . . . some of our duties in order to secure a lowering of foreign tariff walls.”<span class="citation" data-cites="roosevelt1932-09-29"><sup>1</sup></span></strong> The idea was to reduce tariffs in exchange for other countries’ doing likewise, so as to open overseas markets for US goods. This is the trade principle known as reciprocity. Opinion polls demonstrate that Roosevelt supporters expected him to reduce tariffs.<span class="citation" data-cites="norpothAmericanVoter19322019"><sup>2</sup></span> Herbert Hoover vigorously opposed reducing tariffs and warned that if it happened, <strong>“The grass will grow in [the] streets of a hundred cities, a thousand towns.”<span class="citation" data-cites="hoover1977"><sup>3</sup></span></strong> Roosevelt won the election and the right to reduce tariffs; his inaugural parade included a group of men with lawnmowers marching through the streets of Washington, DC.<span class="citation" data-cites="rauchwayWinterWarHoover2018"><sup>4</sup></span> Once in office, he acquired the power to negotiate lower tariffs on a reciprocal basis.</p>
<p>To fulfill Roosevelt’s campaign promise, the Reciprocal Tariff Agreement Act of 1934 amended the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to allow the president to make trade agreements with foreign countries <strong>“so that foreign markets will be made available.”</strong> The law aimed at <strong>“increasing the purchasing power of the American public”</strong> and <strong>“restoring the American standard of living.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ActAmendTariff1934-06-12"><sup>5</sup></span></strong> It enacted the idea of reciprocity; the US and another country would each agree to lower rates to improve trade between the two. It incorporated an idea of gradualism—in no case could the reduction in rate be more than fifty percent of the Smoot-Hawley rate.<span class="citation" data-cites="tasca1938"><sup>6</sup></span> And although it described bilateral agreements, when those agreements included most-favored-nation clauses—which was language ensuring that any nation signing an agreement would gain any advantage later secured by any other nation signing an agreement—the Roosevelt administration acquired the means to gradually liberalize trade with many parties.<span class="citation" data-cites="allen1953-03"><sup>7</sup></span> Within three years the administration negotiated sixteen agreements and more would soon follow, increasing trade among participating countries.<span class="citation" data-cites="tasca1938"><sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p>I want to focus now on the mechanism for reducing tariffs, and for reducing them gradually, which was as important as the general aim of lower tariffs.</p>
<p>Let me talk first about gradualism. Roosevelt appreciated the need for a gentle shift away from protectionism. As he said privately, protectionism might be <strong>“all right today”</strong> but he opposed it <strong>“as a long-term policy,”</strong> saying, <strong>“in the long run it would work against us and our world trade and our industry.”<span class="citation" data-cites="rauchwayWinterWarHoover2018"><sup>9</sup></span></strong> He had similar views about monetary policy; he wanted to devalue the dollar gradually.<span class="citation" data-cites="rauchwayMoneyMakersHow2015"><sup>10</sup></span> In both cases he knew he wanted to make an ultimately dramatic change in the cost of doing business but he wanted to make it without too much disruption to business plans then in effect. So gradualism was the order of the day.</p>
<p>Second, as to the mechanism: the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act delegated tariff power to the president, who would strike deals with other countries. The point of delegating this power to the president was to lower tariffs. By 1934 it was clear Congress had great difficulty doing so.<span class="citation" data-cites="tasca1938"><sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p>When Congress made tariffs, as both William McKinley and Herbert Hoover found to their disappointment, lawmaking quickly became an exercise in log-rolling—you vote for a tariff increase protecting industry in my district; I’ll vote for a tariff increase protecting industry in your district. Log-rolling tended generally to produce higher rates, as every lawmaker looked to get protection for his district. The tariff became a mechanism for providing constituent service and patronage—a domestic, rather than an international, policy, even though it worked by affecting international trade.</p>
<p>By the time of Smoot-Hawley, protectionist lawmakers described log-rolling not as an unfortunate side effect but as an essential feature of tariff-making. As Reed Smoot said, <strong>“the tariff is a domestic matter, and an American tariff must be framed and put into force by the American Congress and administration. No foreign country has a right to interfere.”<span class="citation" data-cites="lake1988"><sup>12</sup></span></strong></p>
<p>The reciprocal mechanism begun in 1934 let the president reach agreements with foreign countries—much against what Smoot said—and let him do so in broad consultation with various experts throughout the executive branch.</p>

</div>
<p>The handout has an organization chart of the trade agreements mechanism set up under the Roosevelt administration.<span class="citation" data-cites="tasca1938"><sup>13</sup></span> As you can see, there are some state department committees, and many more interdepartmental committees—including representatives from commerce, agriculture, treasury, and so on.</p>
<p>This broad range of committees served not only to get input from a variety of sources—thus ensuring everyone got heard—but also to diffuse, and actually to obscure, the process by which a decision got made. A politician or business representative might look at this chart and say to himself, well, this is a nightmare; I don’t know who to lobby—and that’s exactly the point. There were lots of people you could talk to but shy of the president himself, you didn’t know who’s making decisions. And even if you did have access to the president, having this elaborate mechanism allowed the president to say, well, you know, I have multiple, carefully composed expert recommendations; I can’t very well go against them.<span class="citation" data-cites="tasca1938"><sup>14</sup></span> So these economic experts could toil away, untroubled by influence, and recommend action to the president. John Maynard Keynes famously hoped that economics would one day become as dull as dentistry; he meant this as a compliment to his future profession—that it would become boringly professional, rather than heated and political.<span class="citation" data-cites="keynes1933"><sup>15</sup></span> The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (like, as it happens, much of the New Deal) embodied this view.</p>
<p>This emphasis on gradual movement, international agreement, and a mechanism centered in the executive but informed by an array of expert advisors had the intended effect of reaching generally lower tariffs and increasing world trade. By the end of the Roosevelt administration in 1945, twenty-eight agreements were in place and the fifty percent limit in rate reductions had been nearly reached. Congress then extended the authority and allowed another fifty percent reduction.<span class="citation" data-cites="goldstein1993"><sup>16</sup></span></p>
<p>Having the president make international agreements shielded legislators from having to vote for a tariff reduction. And it allowed them to reap the benefits of increased exports from their district. It allowed lower rates and increased global trade. Moreover, the real and widespread benefits to the US economy of increased exports helped forge a bipartisan consensus on free trade.<span class="citation" data-cites="bailey1997-04 haggard1988 lowi1964-07"><sup>17</sup></span></p>

  <title>Teaching the Depression and New Deal</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The editors of the Organization of American Historians’ magazine, <em>The American Historian,</em> asked me to contribute an essay on the Great Depression and the New Deal to a series on “US History at 250.” I tried to get all the salient historiographical points into 2500 or so words. You can find it <a href="https://www.oah.org/tah/america-in-a-world-at-war/the-great-depression-and-the-new-deal/">here;</a> this is how it begins:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Even with COVID and (for the older among us) the 2008 recession in our memories, the Great Depression remains a catastrophe whose scale and scope we have trouble imagining. Historians tasked with conveying it to others try to illustrate scale with statistics, though numbers imply a spurious precision our sources cannot wholly support; indicating its scope requires a grasp of the interconnected national and world economies, and how that web of links, so apparently robust, could be so suddenly swept aside and afterward, only painstakingly rebuilt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It carries on in an effort to offer contemporary points of comparison or contrast, with the idea that might help non-specialists teach it, if they find themselves wanting to do so. <img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/oah_mag/fsa_camp.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Woman at the community laundry on Saturday, Farm Security Administration labor camnp, Robstown, TX; Arthur Rothstein for the FSA. Library of Congress."></p>
<p>The other essays, covering the period of both world wars, might be worth your while too: they’re by Jennifer D. Keane, Lynne Dumenil, Natalie Mendoza, Viola Burlew, and Tom Zeiler.</p>

  <title>The Hitler Diaries</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When up for a lecturership at Oxford in 1998, I received notice to report for an interview at the Indian Institute, then the home of the Faculty of Modern History, in the Trevor-Roper Room. I possessed the maturity to refrain from saying aloud, though not to refrain from thinking, “Are we sure it’s really the Trevor-Roper Room, and not a tea-stained forgery?” Which is a very unfair thing to think about a distinguished historian, but in my defense I was young and the episode of the faked Hitler diaries, during which Hugh Trevor-Roper was briefly taken in by the forgeries, tea-stained to give the appearance of age, was fresh in memory. It might have been the first time I thought about what professional historians got up to.</p>

</div>
<p>The BBC has a good article looking back at the story of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250414-the-fake-hitler-diaries-that-fooled-rupert-murdoch">the Hitler diaries forgery of 1983.</a> Despite the <code>url</code>, there, it looks like Murdoch was not so much fooled as determined to have a story for the Sunday <em>Times.</em> And I felt bad for Lord Dacre, aka Trevor-Roper:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I must say as a historian, I regret that the normal methods of historical verification have, perhaps necessarily, been to some extent sacrificed to the requirements of the journalistic scoop,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This episode was also the occasion for one of my favorite comic strips of all time, the Bloom County bit in which Milo forges (for fun and a news sensation) the diaries of Margaret Mead.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<figcaption>Milo Bloom and Steve Dallas watching a tv report about Margaret Mead’s diaries. When the announcer reaches the zinger, Milo—who knows about it because he is the forger—says simultaneously with the anchor, “Man, those Samoans are a surly bunch.”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It was, and remains, a delight to me that this strip riffed on a contemporary news story in such a way as to make a joke which required you to know enough about Margaret Mead’s <em>Coming of Age in Samoa</em> to laugh.</p>

  <title>Historians and the isolationists: polling</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/williams_hoover/williams_hoover.html">previously</a> said the professional opinion of mine most likely to have me like—</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/polling_ww2/flynn_swords.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>A still of Flynn from the movie <em>Tangled,</em> standing blithely in the center of a circle of swords pointed at his face; it is a popular meme for designating unpopular opinions.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>is that scholars of US foreign policy are far too kind to interwar isolationists. In that post I talked about William Appleman Williams, who is long dead. What about modern scholars?</p>
<p>Well, let’s take <a href="https://networks.h-net.org/group/discussions/20030100/h-diplorjissf-roundtable-review-15-39-connelly-declassification-engine">a claim by Matthew Connelly:</a> that Franklin D. Roosevelt deceived the American people in the run-up to the war. I’m not going to tackle all the elements of this claim in this post, just this one part about what Americans generally thought about the war.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I do not know if there was any alternative to deceiving the American people, who largely opposed what they perceived to be a war of choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Connelly’s claim here is similar to <a href="https://libertiesjournal.com/articles/war-and-the-liberal-hegemony/">Robert Kagan’s;</a> both believe the Roosevelt administration forced this “war of choice” on a reluctant American people for a greater good.</p>
<p>How much did the American people actually oppose US entry to the war, though?</p>
<p>Over the course of 1941, polls frequently asked Americans “If you were asked to vote on the question of the United States entering the war against Germany and Italy [sometimes adding Japan], how would you vote—to go into the war, or to stay out of the war?”</p>
<p>On this question, opinion only very slightly shifts during the year in the direction of “go into the war.” Americans overwhelmingly answer they would vote to “stay out.”</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="./vote.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Click to enlarge: A graph showing support for going into the war in the middle 20 percent, and for staying out in the range of 70 percent. Data from Roper Center iPoll."><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/polling_ww2/vote.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Click to enlarge: A graph showing support for going into the war in the middle 20 percent, and for staying out in the range of 70 percent. Data from Roper Center iPoll."></a></p>
<figcaption>Click to enlarge: A graph showing support for going into the war in the middle 20 percent, and for staying out in the range of 70 percent. Data from Roper Center iPoll.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If that was all the information you had, you would say Americans overwhelmingly opposed US entry to the war.</p>
<p>But: over the same period, pollsters also often asked, “Which of these two things do you think is more important—that this country keep out of war, or that Germany be defeated, even at the risk of our getting into the war?”</p>
<p>On this question, Americans quite consistently answered they thought Germany needed to be defeated, even at the risk of US entry to the war. There’s not really that much of a shift.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="./germany.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2" title="Click to enlarge: A graph showing support for the defeat of Germany, even at the risk of war, running in the range of 65 percent, as against the US keeping out running in the range of 30-ish percentage points."><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/polling_ww2/germany.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Click to enlarge: A graph showing support for the defeat of Germany, even at the risk of war, running in the range of 65 percent, as against the US keeping out running in the range of 30-ish percentage points."></a></p>
<figcaption>Click to enlarge: A graph showing support for the defeat of Germany, even at the risk of war, running in the range of 65 percent, as against the US keeping out running in the range of 30-ish percentage points.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So considering this second result, it looks like Americans were broadly in favor of the US doing what it could to ensure German defeat, even—explicitly—at the risk of the US getting into the war. In other words, respondents favored what was pretty much the Roosevelt administration’s policy.</p>
<p>You can if you like add one question asked at the start of November 1941: “If our present leaders and military advisors say that the only way to defeat Germany is for this country to go into the war, would you be in favor of this country’s going into the war against Germany?” To that, 70 percent of respondents said “yes,” as against only 24 percent “no” and 6 percent “no opinion.” It appears, then, that respondents were willing to go along with the Roosevelt administration’s judgment about the necessity of US entry to war to defeat Germany.</p>

  <title>Andrew Hickey, practitioner of old-school American Studies (laudatory)</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/hickey/hickey_500.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Even though I am not old enough to have encountered the mid-century American Studies scholars when they were flourishing or in many cases, when they were even still alive, the books that brought me into my own career in US history belong to that tradition: <em>American Humor,</em> by Constance Rourke, or <em>Love and Death in the American Novel,</em> by Leslie Fiedler, say. This work is not necessarily <em>right,</em> per se, but it is certainly thought-provoking and inasmuch as that is the point of scholarship, <em>good.</em><sup>1</sup> In most cases it tells you things you didn’t already know and maybe more important it works by making connections which wouldn’t have occurred to a reader not as deeply steeped in the sources as the writer—which is essentially every reader.</p>
<p>Andrew Hickey does the podcast, “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs,” which you have probably already had recommended to you but maybe not because it plainly belongs to that tradition, into which we could also throw Richard Hofstadter, David M. Potter, John Hope Franklin, and some of the other cast of characters from <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo196664682.html">Nick Witham’s recent scholarship.</a></p>
<p>Hickey is an admirable cultural historian in part because he lets you know how he <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/song-177-never-learn-not-to-love-by-the-beach-boys-part-one/#more-2348">works:</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>connections are <em>everywhere</em>. We only see them when we’re looking for them. And they only have the meaning that we impose. Now, this happens to be a big chunk of the way I tell stories — and indeed it’s an important part of the way <em>anyone</em> tells stories. You look for patterns and connections that other people haven’t seen before, and present them to the audience. Sometimes those patterns have actual meaning that sheds light on the history, other times they’re just interesting resonances and coincidences that make for an interesting story.</p>

  <title>Reno, NV, circa 1997</title>

<p>From 1996–1998 I was a visiting assistant professor in history at the University of Nevada, Reno. It was a very good non-tenure track job and they treated me exceptionally well. I made good friends there and learned a lot.</p>
<p>These photos, probably from about 1997 or so, turned up when I was cleaning out some stuff in my office. I took them with my Pentax K-1000 camera; I don’t know what kind of film. Then I scanned them with an app, so they’re not terribly high quality. But they do give some flavor of how the city felt to me then—much smaller than it is today (though of course, the Biggest Little City).</p>

  <title>Wages in Puerto Rico, 1934–1949</title>

<p>Here are a couple charts showing wages in various forms of manufacturing, and then in various other forms of employment (including sugar growing) in Puerto Rico, for five data points: 1934, 1938, 1941, 1945, and 1949. The figures come from a hearing of the Special Investigating Subcommittee of the Committee on Education and Labor in the 81st Congress, held in 1949 and published in 1950, studying minimum wages and education in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.<span class="citation" data-cites="zotero-3048"><sup>1</sup></span> I came across the hearing in a study by the Virgin Islands economist Valdemar Hill Jr.&nbsp;on minimum wages in the Virgin Islands, which a librarian showed us during a visit to the Melvin Evans Library of the University of the Virgin Islands. So I did a set of small multiples for further thought.<span class="citation" data-cites="HillMinimumWagesVirginIslands193819681968"><sup>2</sup></span></p>

<p>Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands came under the Fair Labor Standards Act minimum wage in 1938, which was 25 cents an hour, and then a year later became 30 cents. A June 1940 amendment (<a href="https://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=54&amp;page=615#">54 Stat. 615</a>) put the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on a different basis, with lower rates allowed if established under industrial committees appointed by the wage administrator.<span class="citation" data-cites="macphersonBirth"><sup>3</sup></span> Puerto Rico passed its own version of the Wagner Act, the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Act, in 1945, licensing collective bargaining and other protections for labor.<span class="citation" data-cites="zotero-3059"><sup>4</sup></span></p>

<p>You can see some trends in these data points, but I’m not sure I’m ready to draw firm conclusions, because of course there aren’t all the data points you’d want.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can see an upward trend in 1934–1938, sometimes not. But then of course the end of fiscal 1937–1938—when these wage measures are taken—was of course in the recession of that period. Sometimes you get an upward trend after the FLSA, 1938–1940; but also sometimes not. Often you get an upward trend 1940–1945, which makes sense, of course; there was a war on. And often you get a further upward trend after the PRLRA.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I was looking through a drawer and came across a Bob Dylan-adjacent thing I’d written and forgotten, because <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/erauchway/cv_pub/blob/main/rauchway_cv.html">my cv</a> has only the academic stuff on it. Given the Discourse around <em>A Complete Unknown,</em> I thought I’d share.</p>
<p>Conor McPherson (who wrote <em>The Weir</em>) wrote and directed <em>Girl From the North Country,</em> a play featuring the songs of Bob Dylan. Set in a boarding-house in Duluth, Minnesota in 1934, it wove Dylan’s songs (performed on Depression-era instruments) through a story about that hard time.</p>
<p><em>Girl From the North Country</em> was opening at the Old Vic in the summer of 2017; the director of the company producing the program(me) wrote to ask me if I’d contribute an essay on the state of the country, and Minnesota, at that time. So of course I said yes. They sent me the script, I wrote the essay based on the themes I saw in the play, and it went into the programme under the title “A Most Dangerous Time.” When the production moved to the Noël Coward Theatre in the West End a few months later, they kindly kept the essay in the new programme. The text of it appears below the pictures.</p>

<p>The end of 1934 brought a most dangerous time to America. The four Depression winters following the 1929 crash came on hard. Each one worse than the one before, with more out of work, more going hungry, more on the roads, more families broken up and people broken down. Despair stole over the nation’s soul.</p>
<p>But then in 1933 a slender hope seized the citizens who could see that just ever so slightly, things might start getting better. With a new president and a New Deal came new jobs, and a hard, long road along which Americans were nevertheless heading in the right direction, toward work and dignity and an end to the waking nightmare of grinding want. The president, Franklin Roosevelt, knew how terrible a thing this little hope could be. Before, in the forlorn depths of the Depression, Americans had known chiefly how to suffer. But now, with a little hope in them, they sensed their improved prospects, and felt a new restlessness. And it was, Roosevelt worried, ‘disappointed hope, rather than despair, [that] creates revolutions,’ and with this fragile and unrealised hope in them the people stirred that winter on the brink of action, not knowing which way they might lurch.</p>
<p>Minnesotans felt it, the risk that came with a little hope in 1934. They spent the summer enthralled by an industrial civil war that was called out on the state’s radio stations as if it were a football game pitting communists against capitalists.</p>
<p>The fertile prairie state, rich in grain and home to the headwaters of the Mississippi, had become in the industrial age the trucking hub of the American north-west, where the produce of the heartland could be processed, packed and shipped out again. In the years of the Depression, with scarcely any work to be had, the prices people could pay had fallen so low that it was hardly worth a farmer’s while to harvest the crops in the fields, for the pittance they would fetch if brought to market. Wheat went to seed and corn rotted on the stalk.</p>
<p>But in 1934, with business picking up, the flow of goods into the state’s cities resumed, and on this tide of renewed commerce came an opportunity for workers to claim a portion of prosperity. They formed unions, asking for better wages. There were actual communists among the labour leaders, a fact to which the state’s businessmen pointed in rage but, under the circumstances, to little effect. Minnesota boasted a unique achievement: a daily union newspaper, <em>The Organizer,</em> that turned a profit, and it editorialised in a workingman’s voice that ‘these here bosses we got in town keep yellin’ in the papers that communism and payin’ 54½ cents an hour is one an’ the same thing. Well, if that’s what it is I guess I’m a communist an’ I expect most every one in the world . . . must be too.’</p>
<p>The union went on strike, shutting trucking down in Minneapolis for more than a month in the summer heat. Strikers and policemen fought in the streets. In one clash, the policemen ambushed strikers, shooting them in the back as they turned to run, killing a few and sending dozens to the hospital. The governor, Floyd Olson, a member of the Farmer-Labor Party, had to declare martial law and personally prevailed on President Roosevelt to intervene—which he did, assigning a mediator to force a resolution recognising the union, setting minimum wages and maximum hours. The governor and the president believed they had averted revolution by giving a little to the workingmen; the city’s business owners thought the politicians had capitulated to the radicals and they resolved not to let this new state of affairs last.</p>
<p>In November, Olson would have to defend himself against the charge of abetting revolution, explaining that ‘Communists believe in the abolition of private property. We believe in its creation.’ He pulled out a narrow victory, returned to office mainly on account of votes from the workingmen of Minnesota.</p>
<p>It was so easy for Americans then and later to see the clash of classes as a struggle solely between groups of white people. One of the great novelists of the Great Depression, John Steinbeck, made his reputation by writing a novel, In Dubious Battle, based on a California strike—omitting the Mexicans and Mexican Americans who were, in real life, most of the workers.<span class="citation" data-cites="olmstedRightOutCalifornia2015"><sup>1</sup></span> It was easier to sell books and inspire white people to sympathy for the poor, if the poor were not also people with darker skins. But race played a major role in shaping the Great Depression.</p>
<p>As one African American observed, black people in America were familiar with hard times long before the 1929 crash. ‘The Negro was born in depression. It didn’t mean too much to him, The Great American Depression, as you call it. There was no such thing. The best he could be is a janitor or shoeshine boy. It only became official when it hit the white man.’</p>
<p>The generation of African Americans who old in the Great Depression had been young in slavery. They could remember when the US government had promised them civil rights and, even better, they could remember when it had failed to deliver, allowing white supremacists to reassert control over first the South, and then much of the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Indeed, by the middle of the 20th century, Minnesota, far in the north of the country and overwhelmingly white, was one of the few US states that did not have laws mandating racial segregation. As racial segregation spread across the South in the early 20th century, black Americans began to move north and west, to better opportunities and less racist cities like Minneapolis and Duluth, where a few hundred African Americans lived by the time of the Depression.</p>
<p>It was moving that gave the greatest hope to African Americans, moving out of the South to a part of the country where white folks’ prejudice, though vicious, did not altogether stop black citizens from staking a claim to their rights.</p>
<p>In the Depression, all kinds of people sought relief by moving. Maybe they had lost a job and a home or a farm and all went on the road together, a family living out of whatever excuse for an automobile they could find, like Steinbeck’s fictitious Joad clan headed from Oklahoma to California in <em>The Grapes of Wrath.</em> Maybe—more often—it was one man alone, leaving his family and relieving them of the burden his empty stomach imposed, hoping he would find work and be able to send a little money home. A woman and her children were more sympathetic, more deserving of charity, without a working-age man in the house.</p>
<p>Often it was the crush of debt that caused families to split up or lose their homes this way; it happened all over the country through the Depression and more in 1934, as a drought set in on the plains. With ever-lower incomes, farmers couldn’t afford their mortgages. Bankers, deprived of their payments, seized homes and farms in a wave of foreclosures.</p>
<p>In 1934, owing to Minnesota, the highest court in the nation was deciding whether the government could do anything to relieve its citizens from this financial crush. Fearing a revolution from the state’s overburdened borrowers, Governor Olson declared that—for a while at least—no sheriff, constable or police officer of the state could carry out a bank’s order to foreclose. The legislature backed him up. As Olson said, he didn’t know if he had the legal authority to stop banks, even temporarily, from taking Minnesotans’ houses, but it was necessary for ‘preserving order within the boundaries of this state.’</p>
<p>Asked to decide whether the state could thus step in to fend off the bankers, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes of the US Supreme Court ruled in 1934 that it might. Even though the right of private property was vital to the American tradition, the Chief Justice cited ‘a growing appreciation of public needs and of the necessity of finding ground for a rational compromise between individual rights and public welfare’ to let Minnesota lawmakers force a sense of mercy on the state’s creditors and permit a moratorium on foreclosures.</p>
<p>Earthly mercy is never so eternal as the divine variety. Even with this relief from state and federal authorities, the Depression would continue to weigh on Americans of all kinds. The state could stave off debt, give you a job, afford relief, but the sum total of the reckoning one owed might still seem insurmountable. The suicide rate generally rises with unemployment, and it peaked in 1932. But even a couple of years onward it had not dropped to an ordinary level. Americans still had an uncertain hope in what this world could offer, and wavered between faith in their ability to save each other, and unbelief.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I had the opportunity of a pleasant chat with Don Wildman of <em>American History Hit</em> about the Hoover-to-Roosevelt era (arguably a thing I’m expert on) and it became two episodes of that podcast, which you can listen to here if you like:</p>
<p><a href="https://shows.acast.com/american-history-hit/episodes/president-herbert-hoover-did-he-cause-the-great-depression">Hoover</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shows.acast.com/american-history-hit/episodes/fdr-the-new-deal">Roosevelt</a></p>
<p>I do like the opportunity of a good talk about these things, and judging by the email one gets sometimes people like to listen to them.</p>

<p>This post is no profounder than to observe that this (rather lovely, to me) Jack Delano photo of 1941, for the Farm Security Administration, of sugarcane cultivators at the Bethlehem estate of the Virgin Islands Company on St.&nbsp;Croix, reminds me of the Winslow Homer painting, “The Veteran in a New Field,” of 1865.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The Bethlehem estate on St.&nbsp;Croix was a property previously worked by the (Danish) West Indian Sugar Company, which the Roosevelt administration succeeded in purchasing and parceling out as homesteads available only to Virgin Islanders or people who had already been resident in the Virgin Islands for three years (most went to native Crucians; fewer to Puerto Rican migrants). The Virgin Islands Company bought the homesteaders’ sugarcane, making some of it into Government House Rum. That also is a whole other story, though.</p>
