  <title>A Brief Remembrance of Dan Howe as a Colleague</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/2026-01-11_dwh/dwh.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/in-memoriam-daniel-walker-howe-pulitzer-prize-winner-history-professor">Dan Howe</a> spoke with a deliberation that inspired in me both admiration and antsiness, with pauses indicating the care he was taking in formulating the phrase to come. Like many historians I first met Dan through his writing, which featured the precision of his speech while omitting the pauses. As an eager student I could take Dan’s insights at my own speed, reading with delight his accounts of the self-serious young American republic’s thinkers in action, as the Whigs seemed to me then. What Dan was doing, what my advisor George Fredrickson was doing, what a few other scholars were then doing (notably, Ann Douglas) excited me. They treated ideas like serious business. I wanted to do it too.</p>
<p>Dan had the sunniest temperament of any professor I have known. He had a wide ready smile that seemed to persist while he talked and even over the phone—even when he was possibly quite cross—you could hear the upturned corners of his mouth. Together with his broad chin and glasses, that smile made him look uncannily like Franklin Roosevelt, with whom he shared that impression of invariable cheer and also the capacity to deliver a sly jab, the more unexpected for the enduring smile.</p>
<p>Now that I am closer to Dan’s age then than to my own youth I can appreciate that as his junior colleague I must have seemed to him a bit like the cartoon dog Chester, hopping up and down and around, asking his methodical companion “what are we going to do today, Spike? what are we going to do?” Except, of course, Spike would be smiling.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>In another university Dan wouldn’t have had to spend as much time listening to me as he did, but there were, I think, only four post-holders in US history then and Dan was tasked with administering them. I have since learned that not all senior colleagues or administrators are as tolerant or willing to give young people free rein. But Dan was patient and supportive where many people might have been obstinate and discouraging. He let me try ambitious things.</p>
<p>Five or so years later—after we had both moved on—when Dan published <em>What Hath God Wrought,</em> the enjoyment with which I read the book brought back to me the happiness wth which I had first read Dan’s work. I am glad I got a chance to chat with him and congratulate him on it.</p>
<p>But I am always going to remember Dan for the way he spoke and how evidently happy he was for others to succeed. I will always remember both in the voice message he left for me, eight time zones away, when he called to tell me I had got the job—which I felt meant I was going to have an academic career after all.</p>
<p>“Hullo, Eric! this is Dan Howe. I’m calling with”—long, thoughtful pause; I expect he was deciding how discreet this recording had to be—“good news!” Sometimes he was; it seemed like he always wanted to be.</p>

  <title>The Franklin Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/2026-01-09_monroe_d/2026-01-09_monroe_d.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>On December 28, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt <a href="http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/msf/msf00691">argued to the members of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation in Washington DC that</a> “the maintenance of law and the orderly processes of government in this hemisphere is the concern of each individual nation within its borders first of all. It is only if and when the failure of orderly processes affects the other nations of the continent that it becomes their concern; and the point to stress,” he underlined,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>is that in such an event it becames the joint concern of a whole continent in which we are all neighbors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a few days before, the United States had joined the other American nations at Montevideo in agreeing to a convention including the <a href="https://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-40.html">provision,</a> “No state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.” Roosevelt had already publicly stated <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/monroe_d/monroe_d.html">he wanted to get rid of the Platt Amendment,</a> guaranteeing the US right to intervene in Cuba; the Montevideo conference generalized that idea, and his speech in Washington extended it to a broad modification of the Monroe Doctrine.</p>
<p>Ernest Gruening, an anti-imperialist journalist and historian of Mexico who had served as an aide to the US delegation in Montevideo, wrote,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>this epoch-making policy has gone far to remove the accumulated suspicion and fear inculcated by a generation of military and financial penetration. The Franklin Roosevelt extension of the Monroe Doctrine had replaced the Theodore Roosevelt intensification of that doctrine of 30 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It meant “the New Deal is being extended, as far as lies within our province, to the New World,” and that the administration was “giving up the pursuit of empire.”<span class="citation" data-cites="grueningNew1934"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

  <title>How to Renovate the White House</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/whitehouse/whitehouse.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 1934, the Public Works Administration undertook renovation of the West Wing of the White House, increasing its office space and moving the Oval Office to its present location. In <a href="http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/msf/msf00734">his fifth “fireside chat” radio address,</a> of June 28, 1934, Roosevelt discussed the construction.</p>
<p>The president explained there would be modern plumbing, wiring, and air conditioning, as well as increased office space:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But the structural lines of the old Executive Office Building will remain. The artistic lines of the White House buildings were the creation of master builders when our Republic was young. The simplicity and the strength of the structure remain in the face of every modern test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you needn’t worry: nobody was going to add “some strange new Gothic Tower, or a factory building or perhaps a replica of the Kremlin.” You see, the new construction was a metaphor for the New Deal:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the new structure shall blend with the essential lines of the old. . . . All that we do seeks to fulfill the historic traditions of the American people. Other nations may sacrifice democracy for the transitory stimulation of old and discredited autocracies. We are restoring confidence and well-being under the rule of the people themselves.”</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>It’s a fascinating speech in other ways—Roosevelt talks here about the “three R’s,” which are actually four, and about including the American people of the territories in his conception of the nation. But for some reason the White House renovation metaphor struck me.</p>

<p>W. Kingsland Macy, chair of the New York Republican State Committee, had this to say about Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Look out you don’t make the mistake of liking Roosevelt. . . . I’ve seen people taken in by it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“By what?” he was asked.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Macy groped for words, finally burst out with, “By a perfectly grand political personality, you fool!”<span class="citation" data-cites="looker1932"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/trump-and-mamdani-sitting-in-a-tree/">the mayor elect of New York met the president today.</a> The president <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paleofuture.bsky.social/post/3m66ikvtt2s2c">remarked</a> of the mayor elect, “he’s a big fan of the New Deal I guess.”</p>

  <title>Historiographical Hot Take</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/hot_take/hottake.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It’s time for Historiographical Hot Take Halloween!<sup>1</sup> Let’s spin the wheel and see this year’s Terrifyingly Toasty Take:</p>
<p>There are two (2) historiographical traditions in US policy history that have had genuine serious consequences on US policy—and both of them for ill.&nbsp;<strong>To be clear:</strong> I distinguish here between history of policy that is consequential on policy, that is, which affected thinking, and that which merely reinforced existing prejudices; there is a lot of the latter.</p>
<p>The first is the Dunning School of Reconstruction, which held that rather than being an essential project of guaranteeing the civil rights of Black Americans, the period was one of unique corruption best left behind. By the 1930s this idea was commonplace among white Americans. When Claude Bowers published <em>The Tragic Era,</em> Franklin Roosevelt wrote him of his experience talking to his friends—“and they have not been confined to Georgians or southerners”—about the book, which “more than any other book in recent years, had a very definite influence on public thought.”<span class="citation" data-cites="leuchtenburg2005"><sup>2</sup></span> Even some of Roosevelt’s advisees who actively favored and promoted civil rights, like Harry Hopkins, echoed this view, referring to “the incredibly vicious period of Reconstruction.”<sup>3</sup> So although Roosevelt did some things to promote Black civil rights—creating the civil rights section in the Department of Justice—he might have done a good deal more were it not for the pervasive acceptance of the Dunning School among white policymakers.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>The second historiographical school with significant policy influence is the literature denigrating the New Deal itself. Generally this kind of history sets at zero the value of efforts at relief and reform, and asks, how well did the New Deal promote economic recovery?</p>
<p>I have written about this view at some length in my <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/myth-america-historians-take-on-the-biggest-legends-and-lies-about-our-past-julian-e-zelizer/0216b21fa0282c75"><em>Myth America</em> chapter</a> so I will say here only two brief things. First, even if we stipulate that the New Deal slowed recovery, it didn’t slow recovery enough to prevent quite a rapid recovery.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/field_nd/bizcycles_redone.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Chart showing the pace of recovery under the New Deal by the monthly index of industrial production. Click to enlarge."><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/field_nd/bizcycles_redone.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Chart showing the pace of recovery under the New Deal by the monthly index of industrial production. Click to enlarge."></a></p>
<figcaption>Chart showing the pace of recovery under the New Deal by the monthly index of industrial production. Click to enlarge.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And second, saying effectively, “setting aside relief and reform, how well did the New Deal do at recovery” is in effect saying, “How well did the New Deal restore things to where they were”—an aim Roosevelt expressly and repeatedly rejected. The effect is to produce an entire body of literature which finds—perhaps not surprisingly!—that this popular and effective Democratic policy program didn’t do all that well at promoting a Republican agenda.</p>
<p>And yet, of course, that’s the view of the New Deal that was current among members of the Barack Obama administration, including the president himself; it was <a href="https://miscellanycentral.blogspot.com/2020/04/wasting-away-in-hooverville-chait.html">frequently referenced by conservatives during the debate over relief and reform during the 2008 financial crisis.</a></p>
<p>So: two historiographical traditions consequential for US policy—producing bad outcomes. Boo! That’s your Halloween Historiography Hot Take.<sup>5</sup></p>

  <title>The great essayist, or as I like to call him, ‘Babe’</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/fdr_conservative/fdr_conservative.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Running for reelection in 1936, Franklin Roosevelt emphasized that the New Deal had averted revolution. He referred to the threat of communism, but I don’t believe he had ever really believed communism was in the offing; what he really feared in 1933 was dictatorship.</p>
<p>In the course of defending democracy, he argued, the New Deal had achieved the highest form of conservatism.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Never has a Nation made greater strides in the safeguarding of Democracy than we have made during the past three years. Wise and prudent men—intelligent conservatives—have long known that in a changing world worthy institutions can be conserved only by adjusting them to the changing time. In the words of the great essayist—‘The voice of great events is proclaiming to us—Reform if you would preserve.’ I am that kind of conservative because <a href="http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/msf/msf00949">I am that kind of liberal.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway it seems like some people need to hear this sort of thing.</p>

  <title>What this country needs</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/hoover_cigar/hoover_cigar.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Herbert Hoover’s problem was <em>not</em> that he was a technocrat who didn’t understand politics. He was a savvy political operator and a master of public relations who understood that it was to his advantage to <em>seem</em> like a technocrat who didn’t understand politics. So when you say he was a technocrat who didn’t understand politics, you are falling for a hustle, in the manner of someone who perceives Fast Eddie Felson isn’t striking the balls quite so smartly as you had heard.</p>
<p>James MacLafferty, one of Hoover’s aides and fixers, kept a diary and in the entry for April 14, 1932, he wrote about what he called a “morning after” scene in the Cabinet room of the White House.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Cigarette and cigar ends were crowding ash trays to their full capacity, empty cigarette packages were on the cabinet table and on the floor as were also wadded pieces of paper on which memorandums had been made. On the floor, by the President’s chair, were four paper bands that had once been around cigars the President had smoked. I recognized them at once and I picked them up determined that I would make them a part of this history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MacLafferty pasted a couple of Hoover’s cigar bands into his diary. (Because he kept the diary in duplicate, there are two in each copy. One’s in the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa, and the other is in the Hoover Institution Archives in Stanford, California.)</p>
<p>MacLafferty was commemorating one of Hoover’s successful lobbying efforts: the President had cajoled Congress into <a href="https://hoover.blogs.archives.gov/2020/07/29/the-economy-act-of-1932/">cutting federal salaries as a Depression-fighting measure.</a></p>
<p>Now you can say this episode shows that Hoover had terrible instincts, so far as macroeconomic policy goes, but I wouldn’t say it shows he didn’t know how to do politicking. He was able by dint of traditional jawboning and soft-selling to get his bad ideas through a Democratic House majority. He was a very good politician—which doesn’t by any stretch mean he had good policies.</p>

  <title>Some interwar booknotes from recent TLS issues</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/tls_interwar/tls_interwar.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The TLS has recently run a number of essays on books that cover fascism in the interwar period, which thus fall within this blog’s <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/about.html">very sternly enforced remit.</a></p>
<p>Fintan O’Toole <a href="https://www.the-tls.com/politics-society/politics/burn-them-out-padraig-og-o-ruairc-year-of-the-rat-harry-shukman-book-review-fintan-otoole">writes</a> about Pádraig Óg Ó Ruairc’s history of fascism in Ireland, including “the IRA’s collaboration with the Nazis during the Second World War (on the time-honoured but idiotic grounds that ‘England’s difficulty is Ireland’s opportunity’).”</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="./blue_blouses.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="A line of mostly women (Blue Blouses) with some men (Blueshirts) all giving a stiff-armed fascist salute. RTE. Click to enlarge."><img src="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/tls_interwar/blue_blouses.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A line of mostly women (Blue Blouses) with some men (Blueshirts) all giving a stiff-armed fascist salute. RTE. Click to enlarge."></a></p>
<figcaption>A line of mostly women (Blue Blouses) with some men (Blueshirts) all giving a stiff-armed fascist salute. RTE. Click to enlarge.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The book also discusses the Irish Blueshirts, fascists who opposed the Irish government, which they believed “a crowd of Spaniards, Jews and Manxmen” O’Toole aptly notes, “I have yet to discover what the Irish fascists had against the Manx, but the point is obvious enough – it is the far right that generates the alien threat and not the other way around.”</p>
<p>Charles Darwent <a href="https://www.the-tls.com/arts/visual-arts/comrades-in-art-andy-friend-book-review-charles-darwent">reviews</a> Andy Friend’s study of the Artists International (swiftly renamed the Artists International Association, to avoid unwanted if accurate associations), a leftist anti-fascist organization. Though the book covers the period up to 1943, the essay doesn’t mention how the AIA dealt with the pact. I guess I have to read the book.</p>
<p>Catherine Taylor <a href="https://www.the-tls.com/literature-by-region/european-literature/crooked-cross-sally-carson-book-review-catherine-taylor">writes about</a> Sally Carson’s recently reprinted <em>Crooked Cross,</em> a 1934 novel about how the rise of the Nazi government affects a family in a small Bavarian mountain town. I picked up a copy earlier this year when I was in Britain and read it then. It’s so prescient, it’s difficult to believe it was written before the Hitler government had long been in power. Indeed Carson died before the Nazis’ horrors could be fully revealed: she passed away on June 21, 1941, as the Germans were just invading the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Cuba provided one of the first tests of Franklin Roosevelt’s initially ill defined “good neighbor” policy in 1933. Down to the autumn, Roosevelt’s Ambassador to Cuba Sumner Welles had been advising that the US might well need to send troops to Cuba under the terms of the Platt Amendment—the clause <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/platt-amendment">US officials inserted into the Cuban constitution of 1901</a> to permit US military intervention—to restore order after the fall of the Machado government.<span class="citation" data-cites="cronon1959-11"><sup>1</sup></span> But in November, Roosevelt said he wanted <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-statement-non-intervention-cuba">“a modification of the permanent treaty between the United States and Cuba,”</a> which as E. David Cronon writes, “could only mean that Washington contemplated relinquishing some of its rights under the Platt Amendment.”<span class="citation" data-cites="cronon1959-11"><sup>2</sup></span> In the following month, at the Pan American Conference in Montevideo, Secretary of State Cordell Hull agreed to a general nonintervention pledge and in 1934, the US signed a revised treaty with Cuba removing the Platt Amendment. The Platt Amendment, and what Latin Americans called “Plattism” more broadly, was gone; the good neighbor policy, so vague at the start, suddenly had a clear meaning: the era of interpreting the Monroe Doctrine as a general license for US military action in the Americas had ended.</p>
<p>As part of this revision of hemispheric policy, the Roosevelt administration also adjusted US relations to the territories it would not relinquish: Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Alaska, and Hawaiʻi. Each of them would get its own version of the New Deal, including relief, public works, and programs for economic development.</p>
<p>The implementation of the New Deal in Puerto Rico was vexed, to say the least: for all that it achieved, much remained undone, and no party or faction in Puerto Rican politics lacked a critique of the Roosevelt administration’s policies. But many Puerto Rican politicians nevertheless preferred the New Deal to the treatment of their island “as a Caribbean Gibraltar”—that is, as a strategically located military outpost, whose inhabitants’ welfare was of little interest to Washington.<span class="citation" data-cites="ErnestGrueningdiary"><sup>3</sup></span></p>

Had Roosevelt been killed when he was shot at in February 1933, Garner would have become president. The New Deal would have looked a good deal different with the Texan who was (according to Hearst at least) an America Firster at the helm.)</p>
<p>I wonder what will become of the current vice president’s <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/rfk-jr-to-testify-before-senate-committee-live-updates.html#reaction-time">similarly excretory remark</a> about the health and human services secretary’s senatorial critics. Will the likes of Peter Baker (cited above) feel they must clean it up for publication? Or have we entered an era of greater authenticity in rendering vice presidential speech?</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure—especially from the description in the US Navy Historical Command’s <a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/h/houston-ii.html">history of the <em>USS Houston</em></a>—that the caption, written on the original photo, is intentionally whimsical, and the person wearing the feathered cape and headdress of Hawaiian aliʻi (familiar to viewers of <em>Chief of War</em>) is actually Duke Kahanamoku, Olympic swimming champion, longboard surfer, and then-serving sheriff of Honolulu. Duke Kahanamoku would also greet Ernest Gruening, as administrator of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions, in 1937—though apparently without the special garb.</p>
<p>Roosevelt’s 1934 trip was a combined Good Neighbor Policy / Territorial relations tour. He would first visit Haiti, from which <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015049924361?urlappend=%3Bseq=409%3Bownerid=13510798884175400-409">he had ordered the accelerated end</a> of the US occupation (reversing not only US policy but his own earlier views, when he was Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Wilson); he would also go to Colombia.</p>
<p>Maybe more importantly, he visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and afterward Hawaiʻi (the first sitting president to do so). He had just created the Division of Territories and Island Possessions to administer the New Deal in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hawaiʻi, and Alaska—the territories whose people were US citizens—and on this trip he would explain that US citizens in the territories were as much a part of the “American family” as anyone else.<span class="citation" data-cites="frankind.Radio1934 PresidentStCroix1934 franklindRadio1934-07-28"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

  <title>Unconditional Surrender</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/USgrant/usgrant.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>On January 24, 1943, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill held a joint press conference in Morocco, after some days discussing combined Allied strategy in the Casablanca meeting. (Stalin declined to attend.) They met there—they could meet there—because the US army had begun to assist the British army in clearing the Nazis from North Africa.</p>
<p>The most important immediate result of the conference was probably the plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive, but the more important in terms of strategy—and one that was very much, like the “United Nations,” like the prioritization of North Africa, Roosevelt’s personal preference—was the announcement of an Allied policy to demand unconditional surrender.</p>

</div>
<p>Roosevelt believed peace could only come with the utter defeat of the fascist powers. Not the destruction of their people, as he was quick to stipulate: but the destruction of their ability to make war. For him, the war was, necessarily, a war against fascism, not merely against a particular enemy, and fascism needed to be not only defeated but widely seen to have been defeated.</p>
<p>The demand for unconditional surrender was, and remains, debated in its wisdom. As Marc Gallicchio’s <em>Unconditional</em> establishes quite clearly, though, it was the New Dealers’ position; people on the political right—the pre-war isolationists, chiefly—were the ones who preferred an accommodation with the fascist powers.<span class="citation" data-cites="gallicchioUnconditionalJapaneseSurrender2020"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

  <title>Beginning a Planned Program</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/concepts_plan/concepts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>On April 7, 1932, while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a radio speech laying out “a few essentials, a beginning, in fact, of a planned program” of economic recovery; what you might call the basic concepts of a plan.</p>
<p>First, he said, the plan needed to run “bottom to top and not from top to bottom”—in contrast to the recently created Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which put some billions of dollars “at the disposal of the big banks, the railroads and the corporations of the nation.”</p>
<p>He said that even a large emergency public works program “would be only a stopgap,” and said that really what the nation needed was a “cure.”</p>
<p>He then sketched three basic ideas: pushing up the prices of farm commodities “to restore purchasing power to the farming half of the country”; protection for homeowners from foreclosure by protecting the smaller banks and lending companies; lowering tariffs “on the basis of a reciprocal exchange” with other countries.</p>
<p>He said these would be “only a part of ten or a dozen vital factors.” But that “temporary relief from the top down” would not suffice; the nation needed “permanent relief from the bottom up.”<span class="citation" data-cites="rooseveltAlbany1932-04-08"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> editorial board were shocked at this “demagogic claptrap.” The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was “conceived by the best financial and business brains of this country.” As for the smaller banks, “the closing of these little local banks has been stayed and almost stopped.” It had not, of course, been stopped on what the governor would have called a “permanent” basis and would resume and accelerate later in the summer.<span class="citation" data-cites="BottomManApril"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>Roosevelt enjoyed “the howl from the New York Times and other leading papers,”<span class="citation" data-cites="roosevelt1932-04-12"><sup>3</sup></span> as he wrote to Josephus Daniels, who had been his boss in the Navy Department. For his part, Daniels said, “you hit the bullseye”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We cannot win by letting the folks think the Republican party is 51% bad and we are only 49% bad. Some of our folks in Washington have thought if we acted not quite as subservient to the big interests as the Republicans we could win. You have shown that we must have a definite policy and that prosperity cannot be invoked by incantations and lending money to people who do not use it to start the wheels of industry.<span class="citation" data-cites="daniels1932-04-09"><sup>4</sup></span></p>

</div>
<p>Roosevelt would come to emphasize a large program of public works more, later in the campaign; at one point he would say that his proposed reforestation program alone—the idea that became the Civilian Conservation Corps—might employ a million workers.<span class="citation" data-cites="rooseveltChicago1932-07-02"><sup>5</sup></span> And he would continue to campaign on the ideas of propping up farm prices, lowering tariffs, and protecting the smaller lenders and borrowers.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Shortly after the chief of the Bureau of Labor Statistics declined to support a factually insupportable rosy jobs report, the president had him forcibly retired. In 1932, labor statistics commissioner Ethelbert Stewart was indignantly reclassified as dispensable.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have a contract with the Government and it has been broken. Retired? Don’t put it that way. I’ve had a tin can tied to the end of my coat tail.</p>

  <title>Empire of Relief, 1933</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>
  <link>https://erauchway.github.io/posts/relief_pc/relief_st_terr.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1933, <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=48&amp;page=55">48 Stat. 56,</a> proposed to relieve “hardship and suffering caused by unemployment” in the United States, which meant not only the States and the District of Columbia, but the Territories, as the title and the first section of the law stated. The people of the United States in the Territories were also entitled to relief from the Depression, in keeping with Roosevelt’s broadly inclusive message about the interdependence of all the sprawling republic’s people.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Per capita relief in states and territories. Click to enlarge.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As you can see in the chart, relief went to the territories (shown in orange) on a basis commensurate with that of the states. While I’m skeptical of drawing any substantial inference based on the relative position of localities in the per-capita expenditures of the New Deal, the fact that the territories are in the same general run of per-capita spending as the states, and not outliers, suggests to me the early relief programs in the territories were comparable to those in the states. At least, for these four territories: these were the ones whose people were, by law, US citizens.</p>

  <title>Historians and the Isolationists: National Security</title>
  <dc:creator>Eric Rauchway</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/williams_hoover/williams_hoover.html">said</a> here <a href="https://erauchway.github.io/posts/polling_ww2/polling_ww2.html">before</a> that I think scholars of US foreign relations give too much credence to isolationist arguments and now I guess I’ve said it <a href="https://www.the-tls.com/history/twentieth-century-onwards-history/total-defense-andrew-preston-book-review-eric-rauchway">in the <em>TLS,</em> too.</a></p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>I structured the essay around implications of the Roosevelt–Churchill destroyers-for-bases deal of 1940, and in discussing Andrew Preston’s <em>Total Defense,</em> which lays out the case that Roosevelt invented a modern discourse of “national security” that defined threats to the United States more broadly than ever before—indeed, globally and ideologically—I suggest we might not want to accept the arguments of those like Herbert Hoover and Charles Lindbergh that the Axis posed no threat to the United States itself.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>when Preston says that “geopolitical logic came down on the side of anti-interventionists like Hoover and Lindbergh: the United States was actually never in danger of being attacked by the Axis powers”, he is accepting implicitly their narrow definition of “the United States” – one that excluded the people of the US territories, many of whom were US citizens or nationals. It is perhaps understandable that Lindbergh, who was never known for his analytical acuity, should have left such people out of his geopolitical logic; for Roosevelt to do so would probably have violated his oath of office as president. Eventually, most of the US territories listed above did come under Axis attack and even occupation. If Roosevelt defined US national security with unprecedented breadth, then his opponents defined the defensible US so narrowly that they proposed to cede parts of the US to fascist invaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s more in that vein there, though I didn’t get into the nitty-gritty of it: the people in the US territories of Alaska, Hawaiʻi, and Puerto Rico were all defined by law as US citizens. All these places came under Axis attack during the war.<sup>1</sup> US citizens on Howland Island were <a href="https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1705/background/jarvis/welcome.html">killed by Japanese attack.</a> There are of course excellent cases that these lands and people ought not to have been under US government, but they were; and I suppose the morality or legality of US sovereignty over them, however dubious, would not have been notably improved by leaving them to the mercy of the Axis powers.</p>

<p>Part of the <a href="https://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/event/empire-of-the-new-deal">empire of the New Deal</a> was finding sustainable businesses to run in the US territories. Hawaiʻi grew lots of taro (kalo); why not find a market for it? The Department of the Interior ordered taro flour and a drink called Taroco in quantity, to be served in the department’s cafeteria.<span class="citation" data-cites="USOfficialsTaro1938-03-19"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p>Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes was photographed drinking Taroco and eating taro-flour biscuits in March 1938. Sadly, it was only about seven months before the project’s promoters reported to director of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions that “Taro products are having a hard time getting started.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ErnestGrueningdiary"><sup>2</sup></span> Before long the company gave up and sold its assets to another firm that made similar products for local manufacture.<span class="citation" data-cites="rada1952-12"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p>For what it’s worth, we’ve had taro-flour biscuits; they were pretty tasty. Never had chocolate taro milk though.</p>

<p>The TLS has <a href="https://www.the-tls.com/politics-society/social-cultural-studies/every-monument-will-fall-dan-hicks-book-review-tristram-hunt">a fairly bracing essay</a> by Tristram Hunt, curator of the V&amp;A, on a book by Dan Hicks, curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, an institution which Hunt describes (in my view aptly) as “a darkened labyrinth of cabinets” arranged in a “riotously Victorian, deliriously Gormenghast manner.” Adorning the essay is a photo like this one which gives a hint of the jumble that is the Pitt Rivers’s main hall, presided over by the tall Haida totem pole you can see near center, which once stood outside Star House in Massett Village in what is now Canada.</p>

<p>Hicks, according to Hunt anyway, cordially loathes the collection of which he is curator, which perhaps accounts for the ambivalence on some of the explanatory plaques, like the one for that Haida totem, which asserts its figures and stories remain “part of Haida culture.”</p>
<p>As it happens a couple weeks ago Kathy Olmsted and I were on a research trip, mainly to go to archives, but also to see some other Haida, and Tlingit and Tsimshian, totem poles together with a clan house not unlike Star House, in Saxman Village near Ketchikan, Alaska. Together with Totem Bight, also near Ketchikan, and some other totem poles in town, these sites are the legacy of a New Deal program to, as one of its creators wrote, “see that these totems are preserved <em>in situ.</em>”</p>

<p>Under the New Deal, the federal government hired Native carvers to practice and pass on their art, which had fallen out of favor under missionary influence. The explanatory plaques there, unlike the one in the Pitt Rivers, do not assert that the totem poles and their figures and stories remain part of Native culture but perhaps that is because it is obvious; there Native people retain stewardship of the living art.</p>
<p>It is of course true that the Roosevelt reform program in the territories constituted an <a href="https://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/event/empire-of-the-new-deal">empire of the New Deal.</a> Does it matter that this empire, instead of carting cultural artifacts away to the Pitt Rivers, funded the preservation and perpetuation of the artifacts and moreover the art form amongst the people to whom it belonged?</p>
