    "text": "David Irving sued the historian Deborah Lipstadt for libel in 1996, and lost in 2000, when an English judge’s opinion held that Lipstadt was justified in her characterization of Irving in her book Denying the Holocaust. It was one of the most exciting and high-stakes things to happen to historiography during my professional career; that I happened to be teaching history in England at the time magnified it as an event in my imagination.\nLipstadt wrote a book about it, History on Trial, but in this post I want to focus on the books written by historians called to give expert opinions in the case, because it seems to me they were asked to do something unusual for professional historians, but perhaps helpful.\nFor a while I used to assign graduate students Richard Evans’s Telling Lies About Hitler because it echoed his title Telling the Truth About History, and tied into his broader concerns about the historical profession.1 But I came to feel that this feature, which attracted me, was making the book less good for graduate students; Evans may perhaps assume too much of readers, expecting them to know his particular position regarding evidence and argumentation, and to be too aware of the arguments he opposes.\nBut what his book has, and shares with the others, is an awareness that what the trial asked of historians is not what ordinary scholarship asks of historians—although maybe it should: an aggressively forensic approach to developing the evidence for a case and establishing, point by point, the narrative we know. As Robert Jan van Pelt says in his book,\nIn the crucible of a legal case, what we think we know must be, if not discarded, then picked carefully apart to rediscover its basis. Van Pelt’s book, The Case for Auschwitz, seems to me now the most useful of the three, because he explicitly develops the nature of the problem he, and other expert witnesses, faced. He returns—as I think one should—to Marc Bloch for a discussion of the nature of evidence and historical proof.\nThe third expert book that is of occasional use to me as a teacher is Peter Longerich’s Unwritten Order, about Hitler’s personal role in the Holocaust. Perhaps we have no document reading, “Dear Heinrich and Reinhard, Please go ahead and kill all the Jews, like we discussed. Kisses, Adolf.” But there is copious evidence of Hitler’s involvement in the evolution of the Final Solution.3 And this is a question students, perhaps immersed in “just-asking-questions” internet forums or worse, sometimes pose in class.\nKarl Jaspers has what I think is a funny line:\nBut as these books show, there is nothing automatic about the best expert opinions."

    "title": "Ray Moley as a source",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Historians often rely on Raymond Moley’s memoirs for accounts of the early New Deal.1 I have been skeptical of leaning too hard on these sources: memoirs written after the fact are fallible because memory is fallible; moreover, Moley left the administration because he disagreed with Roosevelt’s policies and he came to disagree with them even more, ultimately contributing to Barry Goldwater’s speeches, and so this rupture colored his recollection. But most of all, his memoirs are like all memoirs “intentional,” to use Marc Bloch’s term; as historians we generally prefer sources that serve as “witnesses in spite of themselves.” That is, Moley (like all memoirists) composed his memoirs and in that act of composition made decisions in keeping with his intentions, seeking to influence historical narrative. We’d rather have a document written in 1933 whose author didn’t necessarily mean it to see the light of day, which was supposed to communicate something of importance in 1933, and which therefore unintentionally bears witness when we look at it now.2\nI was able to look at Moley’s papers in the Hoover Institution at Stanford some years ago. They are full of witnesses in spite of themselves, but they also include evidence of Moley’s intention to shape the historical record, which is perhaps more than anything else what put me on alert as to his reliability. Notably, Moley’s papers include the diary of his assistant, Celeste Jedel, covering January 1 to August 1, 1933—essentially, the short period when Moley was of at least some consequence to the Roosevelt administration. Moley directed that this diary be kept sealed until 1976, and included a covering memorandum to researchers, which he wrote in 1972 on his Phoenix, Arizona, stationery.\nThis note says a lot, I think, especially when read together with the diary and with knowledge of Moley’s general attitude toward the early Roosevelt administration. Moley really seems to want to have it both ways: the diary belongs in his papers because he directed it be written but also it includes things he didn’t say should go in it. He didn’t agree with what she said but she was brilliant and had a photographic memory. Also the entries are all correct! I think one can parse this passage so that these things are all true at once, but it requires hard work, and it also requires you to believe that Moley’s grasp of the past from forty years onward be better than Jedel’s contemporary commentary. It is much more likely that Moley in 1972 was uncomfortable with some of the candid, and true, observations that Jedel made in 1933, which often include tart evaluations of other people in the administration, not all of which seem to a judicious historian at all inconsistent with what we know of Moley’s opinions.\nWhether the historian reading Moley’s covering note accepts, a historian should certainly understand it as an indication that Moley remained, decades later, deeply concerned with how he appeared in 1933. He wanted that moment remembered, to be sure, because it was the moment when he was nearest to power and maybe exercised a little of it. But also he wanted it remembered in a particular way; he was ambivalent later about what he did and said then. Which is maybe no different than any other historical figure, but Moley’s note serves as an unusually express reminder to the historian to take care with Moley’s intentional versions of the historical record."

They have a car and (robot; don’t ask) driver; they discuss how they can get there from here.\nLike much Muppet humor, this joke asks the viewer to have a knowledge of show business tropes, of which “travel by map” is one. Many of us will probably associate it with Indiana Jones; here’s what we see when, in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy leaves Marshall College (University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA in real life and apparently fictionally located in Northern California as well) to find Marian in Nepal, traveling by flying boat.\nOf course, as with the Muppets, much that is in Indiana Jones is pastiche and homage, and the travel by map sequence serves the same purpose here as it did thirty years later: nudging the viewer to say see, this is like those old-timey movies. But which ones?\nThe best known example I can think of is Casablanca. At the beginning, the narrator tells us about the refugee trail that leads people fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe to the Vichy-controlled city. As he talks, we see their path, shifting from globe to map.\nI don’t know where this trope originated but I wouldn’t be surprised to learn it came from, or became common during, the years around World War II. As Susan Schulten points out, more Americans saw more maps of more kinds because of the war. Many had never before been overseas or even had to think about it much.1\nCasablanca of course dramatizes the American journey from isolation to intervention in the character arc of Rick Blaine. Maybe it’s also the first real popular instance of the geographical awareness that made that arc possible."

    "text": "The Roosevelt administration considered a series of methods to improve an obstructionist federal judiciary in the 1930s; its best known was the Judicial Reform Bill of 1937, which sought to increase the membership of the federal bench, but before that officials seriously considered the idea of “jurisdiction stripping,” or removing the Court’s right to hear certain kinds of cases.\nThe US constitution, in Article III, grants only limited original jurisdiction to the Court—that is, cases in which the Court is the first resort. So for example, disputes between states come in the first place before the Supreme Court. It appellate jurisdiction—that is, cases that can come to the Court for appeal after decision elsewhere—is broader, including “all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under the Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority”—but “with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.”\nThis latter clause has been interpreted by the Court to allow Congress to remove certain classes of cases from the Court’s purview. The preeminent example was Ex Parte McCardle of 1868.\nOfficers of the Department of Justice considered this possibility fraught for various reasons but chiefly for a practical one:\nOne has only to look at recent, conflicting decisions in federal districts to see this problem in action, such as in 2014 when the Sixth Circuit upheld bans on marrying someone of the same gender, while other courts upheld it; absent a final court of appeal, there might be no way to resolve such a conflict. This concern prevailed within the Roosevelt administration, which turned to expansion instead.\nScholars since then have suggested what Samuel Moyn calls “channeling” or “fine-tuning” jurisdiction, including requiring by statute a super-majority on the Court for invalidating a federal statute, or reassigning final jurisdiction for invalidating a federal statute to Congress itself, which would have to ratify a Supreme Court decision to strike down a federal law."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The September 4, 1941, U-boat attack on the Greer was materially inconsequential, but symbolically vital, and to understand why, we have to think about this particular moment in the war. In this post we will look at this moment in Nazi strategy, just a couple months after the start of Operation Barbarossa, the German assault on the Soviet Union. Although the conclusion of David Stahel is pretty well established—that is to say, that by August the collapse of Barbarossa was already determined; that the failure to put resources into the construction of railroads and other logistical necessities spelled catastrophe—we should remember that even if to us, the tanks racing East look foolishly disconnected from the infantry that could secure their advances, at the time, they looked like the irresistible advance guard of yet another successful Blitzkrieg. As Stahel notes, the British Joint Intelligence Committee thought the Germans would win within six weeks; in the US, Secretary of War Stimson and General George Marshall believed it would take Germany one to three months to defeat the Soviet Union.1\nAnd the Nazi high command, Hitler in particular, thought the same. Victory in the East was certain and imminent, which meant that the German navy need only stay its hand briefly before launching war on the United States.\nAccording to Holger Herwig, Hitler told Admiral Erich Raeder to plan for a fleet of ten “superbattleships” by 1944, for war on Britain, the United States, or both. The Ziel Plan, or Z-Plan, drafted in 1939, sketched out the development of this Navy and, Herwig notes, the plan was modified in 1940 specifically for war on the United States, when Hitler “took an active interest in selecting future Atlantic bases, preferring Iceland, the Azores, the Cape Verdes, and the Canaries”; this in the flush of victory after the fall of France and “with an eye to the future war with America,” as of October 29, 1940.2 Herwig tells us that Raeder and Hitler viewed this plan differently; Raeder thought of it as an alternative to the war with the USSR, while Hitler—who was ideologically committed to the acquisition of lebensraum in the East and the killing of the people currently living there—thought of it as a consequence to the war with the Soviet Union.3\nTherefore Hitler instructed Raeder repeatedly to avoid any incident with the United States, if only for the time being. Herwig has Hitler saying so as early as May 1941. In June, the day before Barbarossa, Hitler told Raeder, “avoid every incident with the United States until ‘Barbarossa’ unfolded itself. After a few weeks the situation would be cleared up.” In July, with the US occupation of Iceland, Raeder and the naval staff requested “immediate armed assault on all USA ships within our publicly proclaimed war zone.” Hitler did continue planning operations in Gibraltar and Northwest Africa to establish an “offensive stance against America” but also repeated his order to wait for outright operations against the United States until the campaign in the East had reached its successful conclusion. He repeated this order again on August 22.4\nAt the time of the Greer attack, Hitler and his naval commanders anticipated a war, soon, against the United States. The navy was eager for it and restrained only by Hitler’s belief that it must wait on the imminent victory against the USSR (which came, even to Hitler, to seem less imminent by the end of August, if still within reach)."

    "text": "Shortly after the German invasion of France in June 1940, the Roosevelt administration authorized Pan American Airways to build and maintain airfields for the US military. The army and navy wanted a network of coastal bases to assure access to Natal, in the eastern part of Brazil—at the narrowest point of the Atlantic. The administration determined that signing a deal with Pan Am would be quicker than undertaking any more formal process, and as Congress had given Roosevelt a discretionary fund of $34 million for such purposes on June 11 in the naval appropriations act, it was swiftly done.1 According to General George Marshall, these airfields were “more essential to out national defense than any other single matter.”2\nThese bases would not, for the most part, be the bases acquired from Britain in trade for old US destroyers, though Pan Am played a small part in setting up the base in Trinidad. These would be new bases, in which Pan Am had its own interest—it wanted a network of runways that would suit the new stratoliner, the first passenger aircraft with a pressurized cabin, which shared components with the B-17.\nSettling on locations for the bases entailed some difficulties. The planners wanted one in Martinique, but the island’s Vichy proclivities made that impossible. The Vichy governor in French Guiana was a bit more obliging and worked with Pan Am in secret—until the Nazis kicked him out.\nAlthough Pan Am made a slow start, the airfields ultimately proved vital, especially in managing traffic to and from Europe bound through Natal. Moreover, as Marshall said in April 1941, the network constituted an investment: “an asset to us for military use and for future trade relations. Anything we can do now toward providing airfields is an enduring thing and not a venture.”3"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Earlier I posted a bare-bones, “just-the-facts” narrative of the Greer incident, from Samuel Eliot Morison’s account. Here are some more facts; as the Dude would say, “new shit has come to light.” Or rather, thanks to Inter-Library Loan, I received some new information that I’ve not seen cited in the standard accounts.\nMorison says the British plane, an RAF Hudson, “dropped his depth charges more or less at random.” I did know that Greer was broadcasting the U-boat’s position, so that it wouldn’t have been all that random, but I hadn’t picked up on that in the account.\nBut there is also the question, often raised, of whether the U-boat commander saw the Greer; you usually read that we don’t know what he observed, or historians will impute behavior to him, as I quoted Waldo Heinrichs doing, saying the U-boat captain “must have regarded as hostile pursuit” the Greer’s continued following of the U-boat. Or consider Kenneth S. Davis’s account: “the harassed U-boat, its desperate commander probably believing the destroyer had made the depth-charge attack actually made by the British plane, suddenly fired a torpedo at the destroyer, then a second one, perhaps a third.”1\nIt did occur to me that someone might have sometime looked into the German records, and (again, thanks to ILL) I can now say the U-boat captain’s state of mind was not so clear as all that. Nor was the firing of the torpedo sudden.\nThe U-boat, U 652, under the command of Lieutenant Georg-Werner Fraatz, had been running on the surface, and then “dived after sighting an aircraft” (und hatte dann nach Sichten eines Flugzeuges getaucht,) according to Gerard E. Hasselwander, who was working with the war diaries (Kriegstachebücher) of U 652. So Fraatz, the U-boat captain, did know he was being pursued by an aircraft—although Hasselwander says that when the depth charges exploded, the crew believed they had come from the destroyer they could hear overhead (glaubte seine Besatzung, daß der Zerstörer, den sie über sich hören konnten, der Angreifer sei).2\nAfter the two hours’ pursuit without further attack, Fraatz was somewhat confused; he could not understand what he called the destroyer’s “hesitant behavior.” (Der U-Bootkommandant konnte jedoch das „zögernde Verhalten” des Zerstörers nicht verstehen.) So he came to periscope depth and had a look at it. He might even have surfaced, Hasselwander says, had not the weather been so good and the high visibility thus a risk to him—he could see, now, another plane above the Greer. At this point, he fired two torpedoes at the destroyer.\nHasselwander says we don’t really know why those two hours passed before Fraatz fired on the destroyer. Maybe he didn’t have a clean shot. But maybe also he had “concerns” (Bedenken)—about what, Hasselwander doesn’t say; but one possible concern would be that the destroyer was certainly not acting like a British destroyer, which meant that it might belong to a neutral power, possibly the United States.3 Given what we know about the division in German thinking about a naval war against the United States at this time, we might suppose that this same division was reflected in Fraatz’s mind."

    "text": "Hasselwander noted that historians will sometimes say or suggest that Lt. Fraatz, commander of U 652, might have mistaken Greer for one of the Wickes-class destroyers the US traded to Britain in exchange for Western-hemisphere bases in the deal of September 1940, and thus a legitimate target; Hasselwander specifically cites Kurt Assman to this effect (Nur Assmann erklärt, daß der Kommandant geglaubt habe, sein Verfolger sei einer der fünfzig amerikanischen Zerstörer, welche die Vereinigten Staaten ab September 1940 Großbritannienüberlassen hatten.).1 I’ll have more to say about destroyers-for-bases another time; for now, I’ll give this post over to a discussion of this possibility of mistaken identity.\nYou can see above a photograph of the Greer and a photograph of one of her sister ships traded to Britain, which became HMS Newmarket. The question of whether Greer might have looked like one of these newly British ships was raised within a couple weeks of the incident, and Time magazine took it up, explaining that the Greer had been modified and therefore looked different from other, once-similar destroyers. It’s true, I think, that you can see this in these photos if you look: the forward stack has been changed, with a “spark screen” added; the stacks have been lowered, too. The guns are different. And of course, so is the livery. Moreover, Time noted, the Greer was sailing on its own, as British destroyers did not. It was, as we have seen, broad daylight—that is why Fraatz did not surface.\nStill, I would concede that the two ships look quite similar and if I were looking through a U-boat periscope I might well not be able to tell the difference. Hasselwander notes further that there is no indication Fraatz thought he was looking at a British destroyer. (Die verfügbaren Teile des Logbuchs von U652 deuten jedoch darauf hin, daß die Ähnlichkeit von Greer mit den England überlassenen Zerstörern Fraatz nicht aufgefallen ist.)2\nMoreover, to repeat again what we noted in the earlier post, Fraatz did notice that the Greer was not acting like a British destroyer, given its “hesitating behavior” („zögernde Verhalten,“ Hasselwander is quoting Fraatz). Hasselwander goes on to suggest that Fraatz didn’t mean the torpedoes to sink the ship, but rather intended them as a (momentarily successful) effort to throw the Greer off his trail (Die geringe Entfernung, auf die U 652 seinen zweiten Torpedo schoß, und die anscheinend überstürzte Art, in der dies geschah, lassen vermuten, daß Fraatz seinen Angriff hauptsächlich als Ablenkungsmanöver gedacht hatte, um seinen Verfolger abzuschütteln. Tatsächlich gelang es ja U 652, bis 15.07 h weitere Horchkontakte zu vermeiden).3\nWe should not, it seems to me, throw out this suggestion absent evidence. But also, it is a bit of a red herring. Roosevelt’s argument about the appropriate US response to the incident did not hinge on the U-boat captain’s knowing that the Greer was a US ship."

    "section": "",
    "text": "How much of a threat did Germany pose to the United States before Pearl Harbor? That’s the big question; let’s look at a small part of it. Historians often say Roosevelt exaggerated the specific threats Nazi Germany posed; here we’ll look at one claim about the threat posed by German bombers.\nIt might seem to us remarkable that in December 1940, airplanes could fly the distance of an Atlantic round trip, but it was not remarkable to claim it. The crossing comes to about a 3,000-mile flight one way, so a return journey would total 6,000 miles. The Imperial Airways seaplane Mercury completed a flight of more than 6,000 miles non-stop from Dundee, Scotland to the Orange River in South Africa in October 1938.2 This feat was reported in the newspapers, together with comparable records. Not only was Roosevelt’s statement simply true, many of his listeners would have known it already.\nLet’s look more closely at Roosevelt’s specific claim. This is what it says in the reading copy:\nAnd here’s what Roosevelt actually said, according to transcription at the time:\nFirst, this claim was refined in the process of writing the speech. Thanks to the FDR Presidential Library, we can link to the relevant folder in the Master Speech File and see that in earlier drafts, this paragraph read,\nThe claim that planes could fly return from New York to London was probably supportable enough, given the flight of the Mercury. But at the seventh draft, Roosevelt changed it (notice the handwriting):\nNow not only is the distance more accurate and defensible—from “the British Isles” to “New England” is more accurately the route Imperial Airways was even then, despite the war, flying; but by changing its direction Roosevelt was, of course, emphasizing the potential threat should Britain fall to Germany.\nSecond, the claim about the outside range of existing aircraft is coupled here with a second claim. It’s clear with these two sentences that Roosevelt and his speechwriters are making a distinction between what the longest-distance airplanes could already do, and what modern bombers could soon do. This observation supports a generalization I want to make and will probably make again: Roosevelt and his speechwriters were quite careful.\nThe claim about how bombers were then developing, and what their capacity would be, was also correct. The B-29, though it was still on the drawing board, would have a maximum range of 5,830 miles. The experimental predecessor to the B-29, the XB-15, had already flown in 1937, and derived from a plan for a bomber with an effective range of 5,000 miles.3 Americans attentive to the news would have known about the XB-15; Major Caleb Haynes of the US Army air corps had flown one on an earthquake relief mission from Langley to Santiago, Chile, stopping in Panama and Peru, in February 1939.\nAgain, not only did Roosevelt make a carefully constructed and factually correct claim, he made one that many of his listeners would have understood to be readily supportable."

    "text": "This is a follow-up to the previous post on Roosevelt’s assessment of the German threat in December 1940, pursuing the big question, “How much of a threat did Germany pose to the United States before Pearl Harbor?” This post looks at the question of Atlantic geography and German ambitions.\nLet’s consider the Atlantic situation at the time of Roosevelt’s speech at the end of 1940.\nYou can see the short distance from Brazil to West Africa; you can also see that French West Africa was at the time under the jurisdiction of the Vichy regime. France had fallen to Germany in June; Italy had entered the war and struck west across North Africa. Though the Italians had failed to take Egypt and were then suffering under British counter-attack, the Germans would shortly organize the Afrika Corps under Erwin Rommel and deploy it to the region.2\nThe status of West Africa was thus anything but evidently secure at the end of 1940, and indeed would only seem less secure quite soon.\nEven as Roosevelt was warning that the Americas were vulnerable to German assault across the Atlantic, Hitler was planning for such an attack. In response to the Roosevelt administration’s September 1940 agreement to trade US destroyers for British bases in the western hemisphere, Hitler told Admiral Raeder that “England-USA must be thrown out of North-West Africa.” He opened negotiations with Spain to trade French Morocco for one of the Canary Islands, to establish a military outpost in the far West of the European hemisphere; he also began to consider whether the Azores could be used “to carry out aerial attacks from a land base against the United States.” German bomber technology would not then support it but nobody could then know of the limits on even the longest-range German bombers then under development, the Heinkel 177.3\nIn the period between the fall of France and Pearl Harbor, Germany appeared to be at peak power, to Germans and to outside observers alike. Through 1941, aware of the impending Japanese attack, Hitler would continue to plan for a German war on the United States, in which an assault across the Atlantic would play a part.4 There is thus no obvious reason to believe that Roosevelt was wrong, or alarmist, to consider the relative narrowness of the ocean or the possibility of a German aerial assault across its expanse."

And in that number one may find the Treasury’s own breakdown of the New Deal budgets, which I depict here in graphical format.\n\n\n\nUS budgets, 1933–1940 by Treasury categories, dividing “ordinary” from “New Deal” expenditures.\n\n\nDuring the 1932 campaign, Franklin Roosevelt tried (as candidates often do) to have his cake and eat it too—that is, to promise both that he would be more frugal than Herbert Hoover and that he would spend extraordinary sums on unemployment relief as part of his New Deal. Roosevelt gave a respectable cast to this pledge to have it both ways by distinguishing between the “ordinary” expenditures of the federal government, which he would cut, and the necessary emergency expenditures of the New Deal, which would grow as large as they must to provide relief. As he said in his speech on the budget in Pittsburgh, (transcript here) under Hoover “our Federal Government has experienced unprecedented deficits,” which needed paying for in taxation, “a brake on any return to normal business activity.” He proposed therefore to cut the expenditures of the federal government—while excepting the emergency expenditures necessary for the New Deal:\n\nwhat I am talking about more especially tonight are the taxes which go to the ordinary costs of conducting government year in and year out—and that is where the question of extravagance comes in. There can be no extravagance when starvation is in question; but extravagance does apply to the mounting budget of the Federal Government in Washington during these past four years.\n\nRoosevelt kept budget-cutting a priority, while also preserving this exception, once inaugurated. The first major New Deal measure after the banking and currency legislation was the Economy Act, which gave the president extraordinary powers to cut the budget. On March 24, 1933, just after the passage of the Economy Act, a reporter asked Roosevelt if he would balance the budget, and the president gave an answer that hewed to the distinction, however inventive, he had made during the campaign.\n\n\n\nPress conference remarks distinguishing ordinary from emergency spending. FDRL\n\n\nAs you can see from the chart, Roosevelt (through his budget-cutting deputy Lewis Douglas) used the Economy Act’s authority to reduce what he considered “ordinary” federal spending in his first budget, and the “ordinary” expenses of the government remained down through his first term. Of course, he more than made up for that drop with New Deal spending."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ultimately, what troubles me most about standard accounts of the Greer incident is the tendency to treat evidence showing the U-boat captain didn’t know the destroyer was a US ship as a gotcha for the Roosevelt administration. Roosevelt’s speech on the incident, and the policy he announced as a result, didn’t depend on the U-boat captain knowing Greer was a US ship; in fact, Roosevelt quite expressly said otherwise.\nA transcript of the president’s remarks as delivered appear in the Master Speech File at the Roosevelt Library in the second folder on this address; big pdf link here.\nHere’s what seems to me the most important passage, so far as the Greer incident itself goes:\nRoosevelt does say before this passage that it was broad daylight and the destroyer was flying the American flag. Moreover he imputes to the U-boat commander the “deliberate design to sink her.”\nBut the key, so far as his argument goes, seems to me here: if the German U-boat saw Greer was a US ship and fired at her, that’s an act of war—but! if it didn’t see Greer and ascertain her identity, that’s “even more outrageous”; it’s “indiscriminate violence,” and even worse.\nThus Roosevelt’s argument does not hinge on the Germans’ knowing they were firing on a US ship. You’d never know it the way many historians talk about it. For example:\nBut Roosevelt’s speech didn’t, as I say, depend on Greer’s identity as a US ship. Much to the contrary; he says it’s actually worse if the U-boat didn’t know it. (Moreover, as previously noted, the Nazis absolutely did mean to abolish freedom of the seas as prelude to war with the United States.)\nFurther: Roosevelt then goes on in the speech to outline a pattern. The Germans had previously sunk the US merchantman Robin Moor, the Panamanian ship Sessa, and the US merchant vessel Steel Seafarer. You could reasonably suppose the Germans didn’t particularly care whose ships they were sinking.\nIndeed, historians now know—or should know, at any rate—that’s precisely the case, both in the specific case of the Greer and in general. In the National Archives, one may find a decrypted message from Lt. Fraatz, of U 652, to the German commander of submarines, dated September 5, 1941, explaining he had fired torpedoes at “DESTROYER, FLING [sic] UNKNOWN FLAG.”2 Fraatz knew Greer wasn’t acting like a British ship. He didn’t think it was a British ship. He was puzzled by its behavior, and he didn’t know whose ship it was. But he fired on it anyway. Which is what Roosevelt described as “even more outrageous” than knowing it was a US ship.\nPerhaps Fraatz, via the various communications channels of Raeder’s navy, absorbed the message given by Hitler earlier in the summer. On July 25, 1941, one of the many occasions when Hitler urged patience, awaiting the right moment to attack the United States, he said,\nAs I say, Fraatz’s specific behavior reflects this general carelessness. The Greer might have been an American ship; it might not. But there was no harm in shooting at it if it were. That’s precisely the view that Roosevelt objected to, describing it as “piracy.”"

Arad was able to discover records of 480 or so such trains and, knowing that “the Germans pushed 100 to 150 people into each freight car,” arrive at an estimate of their burden.2\nAuschwitz presents a trickier problem because it was not solely a death camp. Deportees arriving in the camp went through a selection process from which some were registered and sent to labor; the unregistered were sent to their death. One must therefore look at the number of deportees and the number registered and in most cases, as Robert Jan van Pelt writes, “All the deportees were either killed on arrival, and therefore not registered; or admitted to the camp and registered.”3 He cites the work of Franciszek Piper, who in the 1980s began working from previously compiled documentation and estimates to arrive at reliable figures.4\nIn 2019, Lewi Stone put together a data series including Arad’s and Piper’s figures, together with some more representing Jews killed by the Einsatzgrüppen during the invasion of the Soviet Union (the “Shoah by bullet”) to come up with a time series showing the number of Jews murdered in the death camps as against Auschwitz and by shooting. Stone’s concern is the intensity of this genocide as against others, but for the purpose of teaching World War II, it’s more useful for showing the timing of the Holocaust and its relation to the other events of the war. Stone’s article doesn’t have his raw data, but a piece he wrote for The Conversation does.5 From it one can make a chart such as the below."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On November 12, 1940, shortly after Roosevelt’s re-election to a unique third term in the presidency, Chief of Naval Operations Harold Stark sent a memorandum to the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, outlining the US military position. The document became known as “Plan Dog,” after the US-UK phonetic alphabet for “D” (Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, etc.) because out of the options Stark considered, he recommended proceeding with the one he lettered “D”—a joint offensive with Britain against Germany in the Atlantic, in anticipation of a wider war.\nThe memorandum runs 26 pages and covers a lot of ground. Here is a single paragraph, from page 19, where Stark gives a succinct summary of his argument for US concern about the German threat.\nThe security of the US depends on the security of the Americas; the security of the Americas depends on a balance of power in Europe; German defeat of Britain will end that balance and its destruction or acquisition of the British fleet would enable a German attack on the Americas and thus imperil the United States.\nWe know Hitler thought in similar, if reversed, terms, planning a war on the United States once he had secured his European triumph, though he did not necessarily feel he needed to defeat Britain—merely the Soviet Union, which he expected to do swiftly.\nStark thus believed the first question was how best to preserve Britain from defeat. He rejected focusing on likely war with Japan, or strictly defensive options, and advocated his option D: a joint offensive with Britain in the Atlantic, while keeping a strong defensive posture in the Pacific. The US fleet should remain in the Pacific until war was “imminent.” Assistance to Britain would mean protecting shipping in the western Atlantic, and reinforcing British naval operations around the British Isles and down the coast of Africa, as well as in the Mediterranean.\nThe chief of naval operations further acknowledged that “purely naval assistance, would not, in my opinion, assure final victory for Great Britain,” and moreover that Britain lacked the manpower to win an infantry campaign on its own. “I believe that the United States, in addition to sending naval assistance, would also need to send large air and land forces to Europe or Africa, or both, and to participate strongly in this land offensive.”\nAny other option, Stark believed, would end in British collapse—and thus a serious threat to US security.\nThe memorandum thus recommended joint Army-Navy plans and moreover, “secret staff talks on technical matters with the British military and naval authorities” to assure coordination of the impending war effort.\nThe Army accepted Stark’s memo with the addition that the United States should expect to supply substantial air support in a war alongside the British. The president authorized the staff conversations, and on December 2, 1940, Stark invited the British to come to Washington for joint planning.1"

Conversely, I reviewed the Bird and Sherwin book when it came out, and I know it is not conservative. But if there’s one area where the modern US right and left meet, it’s on the subject of World War II.\nIndeed, one might without too much exaggeration say that the Cold War scholarly left largely adopted the wartime right’s critique of the Roosevelt administration. To prove this statement fully would take more space than this post but I will cite in support of it the Cold War historian William Appleman Williams’s enthusiastic summary of Herbert Hoover’s thinking: “So right it shakes you.” I will also, even though it is not fully relevant here, provide Williams’s description of Hoover’s response to the Bonus Army, because it is hilarious:\nMaybe quoting that is unfair to leftists who admire Hoover, but as I say, it is funny. Less funny is Williams’s conviction that somehow Hoover opposed “the empire” and therefore was a sage we should heed.\nAnyway, without (in this post) talking about whether I think the shared right/left critique of Roosevelt is correct, I just want to note that this sharing is real, and this similarity is most visible in an analysis of the war’s end. As Marc Gallicchio’s excellent 2020 book Unconditional makes clear, for the New Dealers, the war was an ideological war, and one that had to be pursued to the bitter end. Fascism had to be defeated utterly, in Japan as it was in Germany. “The supporters of unconditional surrender were mostly liberal Democrats, and the opponents were not,” Gallicchio notes.1\nBy contrast, the American right wanted a swifter end to the war, which they had always thought was unnecessary, and merciful treatment of Japan so that it could serve as a bulwark against the Soviet Union. As Gallicchio points out, early critiques of the atomic bombings came from the political right, including from Hoover, from Douglas MacArthur, and from MacArthur aide and actual wartime security risk as well as later John Birch member Bonner Fellers. Hoover and MacArthur agreed that an earlier peace would, in the general’s words, “have avoided all our losses, the Atomic Bomb, and the entry of Russia into Manchuria.” Hoover went further; “the whole Japanese war was a madman’s desire to get into war.” Gallicchio notes too that on the postwar right, “it became an article of faith” that MacArthur had, in January 1945, told Roosevelt the United States did not need the Soviets to help finish the war—a story that “was later publicly revealed to be a bald-faced lie.”2\nWithin a few years of the war, Republicans eager to blame Democrats for Mao’s victory in China constructed a narrative in which the Roosevelt administration’s unwillingness to accept peace overtures from Japan had led to Soviet entry into the war against Japan and thus the triumph of communism in Asia. Gallicchio notes that this narrative was “patently ridiculous,” but it was widely accepted among “conspiratorially minded critics of Roosevelt.”3\nGallicchio goes on to note the appeal of this right-wing critique to the later left, citing Oliver Stone’s deployment of Hoover and MacArthur to assert that the Japanese were ready to surrender long before the use of the atomic bombs. And he also notes that “invoking the opinions of the two Roosevelt haters contributes little to our understanding of Japan’s willingness to surrender before August 1945.” But it does highlight the continuity of right-wing and left-wing criticisms of US wartime policy.4"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Admiral Stark’s “Plan Dog” memo sets as a basic aim the “preservation of the territorial, economic, and ideological integrity of the United States plus that of the remainder of the Western hemisphere.” Which for me raises a question Stark doesn’t address: what does he mean by “ideological integrity”? That question is difficult enough when applied to the United States; it’s even more knotty when applied to the rest of the Western Hemisphere. We can take up the question of the Good Neighbor Policy later; let’s look specifically at the United States. A couple months after the Plan Dog memo, Roosevelt would speak to Congress and outline the “four freedoms,” an ideological basis for US involvement in the war: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear—everywhere in the world. I’ll talk more about that speech later, too; for this post I want to talk about the earliest public mention I know of those four basic rights, in a discussion between the Roosevelts and members of the American Youth Congress on June 5, 1940.\n\n\n\nWilliam Hinckley of the American Youth Congress addresses the Dies (House UnAmerican Activities) Committee, November 30, 1939. Library of Congress.\n\n\nThe American Youth Congress (AYC) included a variety of organizations, among them the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, but it was widely supposed to have fallen under the influence of communists. It was also a favorite cause of Eleanor Roosevelt, who liked the idea of being in touch with the young people of the nation, which is why members of the AYC were in the state dining room of the White House on June 5, to talk to the president—and to prod him from his political left. One delegate after another asked him about the nation’s, and the administration’s, lackluster record on voting rights for Black citizens. They pressed him on the poll tax. They asked him whether the Allies were not in fact colonialist powers with at best a selective implementation of democracy. Roosevelt gave an honestly relativist answer, saying that whatever the Allies were fighting for, it was “a better form of democracy, certainly, than Germany is fighting for.”\nAfter a while, one questioner gave him an opening to try something different. How, the president was asked, would he ensure that an Allied victory would produce a better outcome than it had in 1918?\n\nLet’s take this assumption that the world, the people of the world entrusted you to write the next peace. . . . How would America be effective in establishing democratic governments if that is the clue to future peace?\n\nFor this question, Roosevelt sounded prepared.\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of what we would seek. That is something. In other words, we have a program that is no secret. It is the elimination—I have put it that way on several occasions—it is the elimination of four fears.\n\nHe went on to explain these “four fears” as the worry people had that they might not be able to exercise their essential freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of expression—and “the fear of arms” as well as, “the fear of not being able to have normal economic and social relations with other nations. . . . freedom of commerce and freedom of culture, because the two go hand in hand.”\nPressed on this amorphous last point—“Doesn’t it seem there should be a fifth item, that of giving people economic security in all countries?”—Roosevelt said, “Yes, that is the fourth point I am making.”\nAfter the president left the room, the First Lady and Harry Hopkins answered more questions. In the course of this continued discussion, Eleanor Roosevelt said of the president’s positions on aid to the Allies,\n\nA year and a half, two years ago, he said every single thing on defense that he said aloud today to individual members of Congress and gave the very same reasons. . . . Today, they are all running to him because the circumstances, the life of the world, have hit them in the face. . . . But they were not ready two years ago.\n\nThe president’s statement that he had used the “four fears” formulation “on several occasions,” together with Eleanor’s saying that he had been using these reasons for somewhere between eighteen months and two years, suggest—as did the president’s saying that his views were “no secret”—that he had somehow, to someone or several someones, mentioned ensuring these basic rights as the essential basis for US aid to the Allies. But as I say, this is the first public occasion of which I’m aware. And even here, as you can see, the formulation is not complete; the “freedom from want” was anything but clearly framed.\nWhat you can also see is that Roosevelt, whether using this argument with “individual members of Congress” or young, evidently leftist Americans, was trying to provide an ideological answer to why the US should aid the Allies: to fight for a world in which essential human rights were globally guaranteed."

But when I make a mistake—it’s a beaut!”1\nThe article does not give context for the wordless remark depicted in the photograph."

    "text": "A blog containing historical pedantry about the period of the Roosevelt presidency, 1933–1945. Honestly this is mostly research notes, with a focus on primary sources I’ve come across and have something to say about. I don’t want to do current-events blogging. I might eventually throw in a photograph or two. No promises.\nI do know that “necessitous” means “needy” and not “needful”; my thought is that this blog is lacking in one of the necessaries for a blog, that is, a robust history blogosphere. Nonetheless, contrary to Roosevelt’s occasional remark, this necessitous blog is a free (as in beer) blog."

    "text": "The effort to quantify the dead of the Holocaust inspires a queasy feeling, as of dealing with the genuinely obscene, but it is a necessary methodological substitute for the evidentiary absence at the center of the event: that is to say, we have no representative subjective account of it. That is to say, we have survivors’ accounts but, as Primo Levi (among others) points out, survivors’ accounts are not representative. The representative Jewish experience of the Holocaust was death.\nIt is a shocking thing to consider: that, for example, of the 3.3 million Jews who lived in Poland in 1939, perhaps 380,000 survived the war. Historians generally use first-hand testimony of great historical events as an indication of what it must have been like to experience the event. A survivor’s testimony cannot serve that purpose when the dead outnumber the survivors by something like 7.6 to 1."
