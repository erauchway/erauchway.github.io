    "text": "Justices Thomas and Alito have brought the Comstock laws back into the news in an effort to craft a national ban on abortion. The laws banned a lot more, including James Joyce’s masterpiece Ulysses, until the dawn of the New Deal.\nOn March 3, 1873, Congress substantially expanded section 148 of the existing statute defining the scope and activities of the Post Office. The law already banned any “obscene book, pamphlet, picture, print, or other publication of a vulgar or indecent character” from the mails and defined sending such stuff as a misdemeanor for which a perpetrator could be fined not more than $500 and serve not more than a year in prison.1 Now they went much further:\n—nothing like that could go in the mails, and anyone convicted of doing it could be fined not less than $100 and not more than $5000 or imprisoned not less than a year or more than ten years, or both.2 Forty years later, in 1913, this statute and its revisions were summarized in the Post Office’s regulations as below, prohibiting anything “filthy”; the penalty was now not more than $5000 in fines and not more than 5 years in prison.\nThat’s what the New York postmaster, Thomas Patten, cited in 1919 when asking Judge W.H. Lamar, solicitor of the Post Office, what he thought of the May 1919 issue of the Little Review, which contained the “Scylla and Charybdis” episode of James Joyce’s yet unfinished novel Ulysses. Lamar found it “unmailable.” The Post Office found the same of the issue containing the “Cyclops” episode, for political reasons possibly relating to the Espionage Act passed during the Great War; the nation was now fully into the red scare.3\nBut it was in 1920 when the real Comstockery came: Anthony Comstock’s successor as head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, John Sumner, lodged a complaint against the Little Review for publishing the “Nausicaa” episode, which includes a scene—obscured, to be sure, under literary prose—of Leopold Bloom masturbating while looking at Gerty MacDowell on the beach. At trial, a three-judge panel found the publishers of the Little Review, Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap, guilty. As Anderson wrote,\nThe key point there is that the judges confined themselves to the question of whether the particular passage should be understood as “filthy.”\nIn 1933, when Ulysses came once more to court, Judge John Woolsey of the Southern District of New York had the whole book.\nJudge Woolsey had previously established himself as a dedicated scholar; in holding that the book Married Love was not obscene, he mentioned he derived necessary perspective from reading Havelock Ellis.6 He was also a pretty good literary critic.7\nIn short: people think about sex. Sometimes quite a lot. So portraying it—along with the many, many other things Joyce portrays in Ulysses—is true to the book’s purpose.\nWoolsey wasn’t above being a little funny.\nConsidering the entire book, rather than the allegedly offending passage, was an important shift in the law on obscenity.8\nSo Ulysses could come into the United States. And so, as Morris Ernst, the attorney for Random House, wrote in the foreword to US edition of Ulysses, “The New Deal in the law of letters is here.”9"

    "text": "We went to see Oppenheimer in 70mm IMAX yesterday. It was a fantastic experience, but I’m not a movie critic so I’ll leave to others to explain why Nolan is especially good at pointing cameras at things. The relentless pace, over a nearly continuous musical score, struck me as an effective way to keep one’s attention over a long span. The below is a grab-bag of some relevant observations, both new and old, on the subject, stretching back twenty years.\nI am not particularly taken by the complaint, articulated in this newspaper column, that the movie is somehow unfair to Harry Truman. The one scene in which Truman appears is an almost literal representation of the president’s own telling of his meeting with Oppenheimer. I append below David McCullough’s version from Truman; McCullough is of course highly sympathetic to his subject.1\nThe version from the Bird and Sherwin biography of Oppenheimer is here, if you’re curious.\nThat covers the substance of what Truman does in that scene; as to how he pronounces “Nagasaki,” look, Gary Oldman’s Missouri accent is not what I’d call authentic in any respect and that pronunciation is the least immplausible part of it. If you want to hear Truman say “Hee-ro-shee-ma,” though, here’s a link.\nOppenheimer’s principal antagonist in the movie is Lewis Strauss, who I know from his role as one of Herbert Hoover’s circle of long-serving, loyal friends. Strauss played a key part in Hoover’s use of the Office of Naval Intelligence to burgle Democratic Party headquarters in New York, as discussed in Jeffery Dorwart’s Conflict of Duty. “In 1930 the president of the United States authorized the burglary of private property for strictly personal reasons,” Dorwart writes. Hoover wanted to know what Democratic politicians might say about his handling of the Depression. So he asked Strauss to find out; Strauss contacted the head of ONI’s local office, who introduced him to Glenn Howell, an ONI officer. Dorwart’s source is Howell’s diary, which says, “Strauss told me that the President is anxious to know what the contents of the mysterious documents are,” and that “Strauss is authorized by the President to utilize the services of any one of our various government secret services.”2 Howell broke in, and shadowed a Democratic operative for a bit. The break-in produced no significant information, but ONI apparently didn’t like it, as they sealed the records and said they should be kept from the public.\nIn the movie, Strauss exhibits an overly paranoid view of the world, as the Alden Ehrenreich character tells him. That seems consistent with this proto-Nixonian episode.\nI imagine my UC colleague Sean Malloy will have had a rough time with the atomic targeting scene. Generally the movie steers clear—clearer than the Bird and Sherwin book on which it’s based—of the strategy for use of the atomic bomb, which is often poorly represented in popular writing.\nIn short, though, I will note that the probable alternative to the use of the bombs was not an invasion, but rather continued firebombings with B-29s and strafings with P-51s, and it’s not at all clear the Japanese were about to surrender or when they would have surrendered.3\nFor myself, I’m often puzzled by people’s tendency to treat the atomic bombings as if they occurred in isolation, rather than as the logical outcome of strategic bombing as it had been conducted to that point. I’ll link here and, for archival purposes, paste below my old post on this point, followed by an older post on the atomic bombings that I wrote for Eric Alterman’s MSNBC blog “Altercation.”\nI reviewed American Prometheus when it first came out, in 2005, also for “Altercation.” It’s still sort of online, but it’s quite likely to go away, so I’ll paste that below as well."

    "text": "The first nuclear option\nKai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005. xiv+722 pp. Illustrations, notes and index. Cloth, US$35\nby Eric Rauchway\nAlbert Einstein thought Robert Oppenheimer was a fool for love, and an especially worthless kind of love at that: “he loves a woman who doesn’t love him – the United States government.” (pp. 503-4) To love one’s country – certainly this was worthwhile. But to love a government, when it is going to destroy your reputation? That, Einstein, said, made Oppenheimer a grade-A “narr [fool].” (p. 495) Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s life of Oppenheimer makes a good case that Einstein was right. They thus raise the difficult question, what kind of society makes a martyr out of a fool?\n\nPhysics\n\nNo matter what else happened, Oppenheimer was always going to be an important physicist. Casual readers of American Prometheus might miss this point, because Oppenheimer was a scholar of a kind that other scholars don’t fully appreciate, and Bird and Sherwin salt their text with cutting if not catty comments even from Oppenheimer’s friends: “He never did any great physics,” said his first-ever doctoral student, Melba Phillips. (p. 89) Murray Gell-Mann said, “He didn’t have Sitzfleisch…. Perseverance, the Germans call it Sitzfleisch, ‘sitting flesh,’ when you sit on a chair…. He didn’t have patience for that….” (p. 375) And that is what most academics have, and what we will, if asked, say we most respect – the ability to apply yourself single-mindedly to a problem until you can deliver an authoritative answer no matter how long it takes. The cult of Sitzfleisch reinforces the myth of the lone scholar pitting his genius against the puzzles of nature.\nIn truth academic progress occurs within a community, and such communities need their Oppenheimers. For although he did do some good physics himself he had a much more important capacity for coaxing better work from other scholars. A seminar produced sharper insights when Oppenheimer was in the audience, because he could sum up the speaker’s main points better than the speaker himself, and make the right links between the matter at hand and other issues.\nIn an academic environment, an Oppenheimer is to other professors as the conductor is to an orchestra. The conductor can play several instruments, at least a little, and perhaps has potential to play one superbly. But he rejects mastery of one instrument in favor of an overview of them all. He becomes a complex and opaque figure to the other musicians, who cannot understand how he can keep so many different parts of the score in his head at once. They convince themselves he cannot. He doesn’t write the score or play the music. But he develops the talent around him and the symphonic performance bears his unmistakable imprint: even if the first violins think that really, they could carry on just as well without the guy tapping his baton at the podium, they’re wrong.\nSo with Oppenheimer, who was a great interpreter, clarifier, and assembler of other scholars’ ideas, and who brought out the best in them. And in the end, he got the job best-suited to his talents and in which he could best serve civilization. After the war and almost until his death in 1967 he directed the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and apparently conducted that rarefied collection of scholars in the historical and hard sciences with a deft hand.\nIt was where he always should have been. But as a physicist will tell you, while it is easy to figure the path and destination of a body in motion if you’re allowed to ignore outside influences, it becomes a little harder when you add an external, attractive influence. If you add two external attractive influences, it becomes impossible, the body’s motion grows chaotic. Even if you can tell generally where it will go, you can’t be sure how it will get there. And Oppenheimer the important physicist fell prey to two external influences. Before becoming the conductor of the IAS, he responded to the call of patriotism and demonstrated his ability to catalyze groups of academics by orchestrating the Manhattan Project. And before that, he fell under the influence of communism.\n\nCommunism\n\nIn 1928, after completing his graduate work at Cambridge and Göttingen, Oppenheimer accepted simultaneous appointments at Caltech and UC Berkeley, spending half the year at each. And in about 1934, according to Bird and Sherwin, he began associating with communists. Oppenheimer’s landlady in Berkeley was a communist. In 1937, Oppenheimer’s brother Frank (a physics grad student at Caltech) joined the Communist Party. So did many of Oppenheimer’s friends, and in particular one girlfriend, Jean Tatlock, whom he went on seeing even after his wedding to Kitty Puening, and after his appointment to Los Alamos.\nAs American Prometheus tells the story, Oppenheimer came to communism for non-communist reasons. The news from Oppenheimer’s grad-school friends in Nazi Germany was bad and getting worse; in the Bay Area, the longshoremen were striking and the governor was calling out the National Guard to break heads; by 1935 the communist party was aggressively pursuing its toned-down, “popular front” strategy in which it played down its revolutionary intentions in favor of alliances with other, non-Marxist leftists. Frank Oppenheimer never found communist theory compelling but “he was deeply moved by the deplorable condition of local [California] farm laborers and Negroes,” and he had heard about “‘some of the terrible things’ that were happening in Hitler’s Germany, and he was inclined to support any group determined to ‘do something about it.’” (p. 132)\nRobert Oppenheimer, touched by all these considerations and also by the Spanish Civil War, gave money regularly to the Communist Party through two of its members, a Stanford physician named Tom Addis and an organizer named Isaac Folkoff, for aid to the anti-Franco Republicans in Spain and to refugees from Hitler’s regime. “I doubt that it occurred to me that the contributions might be directed to other purposes than those I had intended, or that such purposes might be evil. I did not then regard Communists as dangerous, and some of their declared objectives seemed to me desirable,” Oppenheimer later said. (p. 123)\nAs Bird and Sherwin note, after years of listening at keyholes and wearing out shoe leather, the FBI “would never resolve the question of whether or not Robert [Oppenheimer] was a CP member – which is to say there was scant evidence that he was.” (p. 142) Certainly, if even the G-men couldn’t bring themselves quite to condemn Oppenheimer as officially Red, nobody could. And yet he was embedded in a communist milieu: “his associations with Communists were a natural and socially seamless outgrowth of his sympathies and his station in life.” (p. 136) So much so that, despite the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939, he stayed close to the Communist Party and continued making his sizable donations to the party until April 1942. In May 1942, he became a research director for the S-1 Committee, created by Franklin Roosevelt to report on the possibility of making an atomic bomb.\n\nPatriotism\n\nAs a research director, Oppenheimer’s talent for conducting emerged: he “showed a refined, sure, informal touch,” Edward Teller said. “I don’t know how he acquired this facility for handling people.” (p. 181-182) General Leslie Groves, appointed by the Army to supervise S-1 spotted this talent in Oppenheimer, and in October 1942 had Oppenheimer appointed director of what was soon known as the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer picked Los Alamos as the place.\nThere is more on the physics and engineering of the atomic bomb in Richard Feynman’s “Los Alamos from Below” than in American Prometheus. And perhaps this is as it should be: in Bird and Sherwin’s account, the bomb was something that Oppenheimer “organized into existence” (p. 314) and Oppenheimer’s success was therefore one of organization, not science. When the Allies smuggled the Danish physicist Niels Bohr out of Copenhagen, he thought an atomic bomb intriguing but unlikely, Bird and Sherwin write: “the engineering necessary for separating out U-235 [the explosive isotope of uranium] would require an immense, and therefore impractical, industrial effort.” (p. 269) But on his arrival in the United States, Bohr realized that America, properly motivated, was more than up to the task.\nAnd so were Americans, which is why Oppenheimer – who in 1940 had been ghost-writing non-interventionist briefs for the Communist Party (pp. 144-145) – took the job, and took it wholeheartedly. Alone among the scientists going to Los Alamos, he wanted to wear a military uniform, and had one made up. (The other physicists swiftly dissuaded him from putting it on.) “There was,” Bird and Sherwin persuasively argue, “a lot of apple pie in Robert’s psyche.” Robert Wilson said “Oppie would get a faraway look in his eyes … and tell me this war was different from any war ever fought before; it was a war about the principles of freedom…. a people’s army and a people’s war… It’s the same kind of language [he used before the war], except that now it has a patriotic flavor, whereas before it had just a radical flavor.” (pp. 210-211)\nPartly because his patriotism shone so purely, Groves and the Army discounted any suggestion that Oppenheimer was a security risk to the project, from which the Soviets were excluded – even when Oppenheimer mentioned that he had been approached by a Communist friend, Haakon Chevalier, about passing information to the Russians. Oppenheimer said that he replied, “But that would be treason.” (p. 196) And for the duration of the war, that was good enough.\n\nChaos\n\nThe bomb exploded as advertised. Bird and Sherwin present a version of the decision to drop the bomb in which the war “would surely end” prior to the planned invasion of Japan (p. 301); this is controversial (as Altercation readers know) and they admit the controversy in their endnotes. But it accords with what Oppenheimer came to believe about the bomb, and he lobbied hard for a nonproliferation policy and refused to work on the proposed hydrogen bomb.\nYet he also loved what the bomb did for him. “[H]e had grabbed a metaphorical gold ring and he was happily waving it aloft,” Bird and Sherwin write. (p. 316) He “grew comfortable with the adulation.” (p. 323) So, to assuage his guilt, he quit as director, but to satisfy his zeal for insiderhood, he stayed on as a consultant.\nOppenheimer wanted to wear the uniform but he hated killing people. He had proven immeasurably useful to the U.S. government but he did not want to go on being useful. From this point forward, it was inevitable that the fallout from the volatile combination of Oppenheimer’s past communism and present enthusiasm for insiderhood would poison his career. Bird and Sherwin make it happen in good, brisk prose. A villain, hostile to Oppenheimer for personal or no reasons, arises. A committee forms. Old allegations resurface. In a crisis some old friends – Teller, Groves – prove useless or worse. The committee strips Oppenheimer of his security clearance. Humiliated, he goes back to where he always belonged, in the Princeton idyll.\nOther friends stand by him, even though they agree with Einstein. I.I. Rabi said of Oppenheimer that “[i]n addition to being ‘very wise, he was very foolish.’” (p. 211) Rabi thought Oppenheimer fatally afflicted with the desire to remain himself, yet to have a status denied to people like him: “He was East German Jewish, and what happened to them was that they began to value the German culture above their own…. I think he had fantasies thinking he was not Jewish,” Rabi said. If he meant Oppenheimer had fantasies about not being an outsider, then in Bird and Sherwin’s telling he was correct. But neither could Oppenheimer make the sacrifices necessary to become an insider – either during the war or after. “God knows I’m not the simplest person,” Rabi said, “but compared to Oppenheimer, I’m very, very simple.” (p. 77) Bird and Sherwin’s story, littered with insights from acute observers like Einstein, Feynman, Rabi, and Wilson, peopled with the powerful, has at its center this complex figure. A simpler man might command more sympathy and might have evaded destruction. But a simpler man might not have led so many talented people to build the bomb so fast."

    "section": "One Bomb",
    "text": "One Bomb\nOn this day in 1945, Harry Truman said, “The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.” Or anyway, that’s the recording I’ve previously heard; it differs a little from his officially prepared statement: “Sixteen hours ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese Army base.”\nLet’s begin with the wording. You wouldn’t normally say, “Hiroshima, a military base” any more than you would say, “Oakland, a military base” or “Seattle, a military base,” or “Houston, a military base”—well, you get the idea. You would normally say, “Hiroshima, a city.”\nIndeed it would make greater sense to say “Hiroshima, a military target”—for the Second World War was an industrial war, and civilians did work essential to the war effort throughout the factory towns of the combatant nations. Thus one could make the argument that any considerable city was a legitimate military target.\nAnd throughout the war cities had been targeted. From the time of the aerial bombardments in the First World War, people throughout the world had known that cities would be bombed in the next war and that civilians would be killed, as indeed they were through various small wars in the 1920s. The vision of Atlanta aflame in Gone with the Wind is as much anxious portent of the coming urban infernos as it is a reflection on the Civil War. From the first in the burgeoning big war—from Guernica, Warsaw, the blitz of London; from Coventry through the V-2 assaults (engineered by that great American Wernher von Braun); including Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo among others—cities came under fire.\nBut despite this precedent Truman did not say “Hiroshima, a city” nor even “Hiroshima, a military target.” One might therefore conclude that Truman did not want to speak of Hiroshima as a city, even a city that might legitimately be targeted under the circumstances of a war that had seen plenty of cities targeted.\nWhat was the nature of his unwillingness to make this case? I think it derives in part from a key phrase in the prepared statement: “one bomb.” The atomic bomb was not a precision weapon. Even if you sent waves of B-24’s, B-17’s, or B-29’s to hit a city you could still claim (though, it’s true, with decreasing plausibility as the war went on) that you were not targeting the city, but that you were targeting military sites within the city, and that any civilians killed, whether by stray bombs or by the cumulative firestorms sometimes raised by the incendiary weaponry, were unfortunate if inevitable casualties. (Not everyone made such claims, of course.)\n“One bomb” meant that you couldn’t pretend to yourself or anyone else that you weren’t going to kill civilians, that you weren’t targeting a city—by definition the center of a civilization. This feature of atomic weaponry is one—perhaps the most important—of the particularly horrifying features of nuclear bombardment. During the revived enthusiasm for nuclear weaponry in the early 1980s, I asked my mother what would happen if the Russians bombed us with nuclear weapons. “Oh, honey, we’d be dead right away. We’re only thirty miles from MacDill, and that’d be a first-strike target.”\nNone of which is to say that Truman, or the U.S., necessarily shouldn’t or under any conceivable circumstances wouldn’t have used the weapon, but it does cast some light on a paradox of reaction to the bombing. By generally accepted account, many fewer people were killed in the bombing of Hiroshima than in the bombing of Tokyo, which it would have been equally if not more inaccurate to describe as a military base. Yet there is nothing like a commensurate level of introspection over the bombing of Tokyo. The bombing of Tokyo took many bombs and bombers; Hiroshima only one.\nIt is useful to remember the bombing of Tokyo when thinking about the atomic bomb. Often, people point out that the bombing saved the U.S. an invasion of Japan and count the casualties of an invasion against the Hiroshima bombing; the bombing thus saved the lives of U.S. soldiers, sailors, and marines. But it is also worth pointing out that had the delivery of the atomic bomb been delayed, any invasion would surely have been preceded by further incendiary bombings of Japanese cities. On this measure it seems quite likely that the use of the atomic weapon killed fewer civilians and fewer Japanese, as well as fewer Americans, than the likely alternative.\nHistorians also make the case that the brutal efficiency of one-bomb—one-city destruction created a sense of immediacy that had otherwise been lacking among Japanese leaders, and precipitated a decision to surrender that had previously existed only in diffuse form. On this reckoning the single bomb was perhaps more effective than continued conventional bombings at ending the war.\nI see I’ve written 750 words on the bomb and only barely touched on two issues—how it related to earlier bombings in the war, and its effectiveness at ending the war. There are other issues; there is an enormous literature on the subject. I’ll put my old discussion of the motives for dropping the bomb under the fold.\nIt might be worth mentioning too, though, that I almost never teach “the decision to drop the bomb” at even this length in class. I spend a fair bit of time instead on the conventional air war, out of which it seems to me that the atomic bomb developed logically. Given the history of the war to that date I cannot envision the U.S. not using the bomb, nor—considering Dresden and the reaction of Americans to the revelation of the concentration camps—imagine the U.S. would not have used atomic bombs against Germany had they been ready in time.\nFrom five years ago: [as it then was; this was 2003]\nToday is the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, which I might not even have mentioned – didn’t we have a big enough fight on the 50th anniversary? Do we have to start ginning up a new one two years before the 60th?\nNichoals Kristof cites “an emerging consensus” among historians: “We Americans have blood on our hands” because of Hiroshima. Borrowing from the President, he critiques “[r]evisionist historians like Gar Alperovitz,” who have shaped “this emerging consensus” that “Washington believed the bombing militarily unnecessary.”\nKristof knows lots of things about lots of things I know nothing about, and I learn from his work, especially on contemporary Asia and Africa. But he doesn’t know “American scholarship” all that well. Even if you’re not an a-bomb expert – I’m not – you can say pretty quickly that Kristof has the wrong end of the stick.\nFirst of all, woe betide anyone who asserts there’s an “emerging consensus” on the atomic bombs of 1945; it’s one of those issues that reliably draws shouty people. And Alperovitz’s work in particular invariably polarizes the profession; reviews of his Atomic Diplomacy and The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb include accusations of professional malfeasance as well as expressions of strong admiration. When historians get to scuffling over his work, well, the tweed flies.\nBut second of all, and more importantly, if you went looking for common ground between historians identified with both the left and the right, you would find quite the opposite of what Kristof says.\nWalter LaFeber of Cornell says, Militarily, the Americans dropped the first bomb to end the war as quickly as possible and before perhaps a million casualties resulted from an invasion of Japan. America, Russia, and the Cold War, 7th ed. (1993), p. 25\nJohn Lewis Gaddis of Yale says, Having acquired this awesome weapon, the United States used it against Japan for a simple and straightforward reason: to achieve victory as quickly, as decisively, and as economically as possible. We Now Know (1997), p. 87\nAnd Barton J. Bernstein of Stanford said as early as 1974, The administration did not decide to use the bomb against Japan in order to stop Soviet entry into the Pacific war or to gain advantages over the Soviets in Eastern Europe or in the Pacific. Rather, the Truman administration acted upon the inherited [i.e., from FDR] assumption that the bomb was a legitimate weapon for combat use against an enemy…. The combat use of the bomb promised to speed the end of the war and thereby to save American lives. “The Quest for Security,” Journal of American History 60:4, p. 1014\nIndeed, Bernstein long ago indicated that what Kristof describes as the Alperovitz “consensus” is dodgy for a few simple reasons.\n\nTruman didn’t per se decide to use the bomb; he simply allowed the existing bomb program established by FDR to go ahead. (This, by the way, is why suggestions that Truman’s bigotry influenced the decision cannot be terribly serious. The bombing had nearly nothing to do with Truman personally.)\nAssertions that Truman, or nearly-Secretary-of-State James F. Byrnes, were thinking principally in terms of scaring the Soviets and not of defeating the Japanese come from other people’s (usually self-serving) recollections recorded well after the fact – after they were persuaded that the a-bomb was something terrible and different.\nThe bomb’s developers didn’t think of it as a deterrent threat rather than a combat weapon. The notion that it belonged to a special category only emerged after people could see what instant, awful and lasting damage it could do.\n\nNone of this general belief that the bombs were going to be used for military purposes touches the question of whether they were used in the best possible way – could they have been deployed against a more definitely military target? Could there have been a little longer delay before the second bomb? How many lives did avoiding an invasion really save? Wouldn’t an invasion have cost Japanese lives too – more Japanese lives, maybe, than the bomb? Working up to an invasion would probably have meant continued conventional bombing and continued blockades, generating more casualties even before the invasion itself occurred.\nBernstein again, this time in 1998:\nIn 1945, before Hiroshima and even afterward, Truman rightly believed that the use of the A-bomb on Japan would be warmly endorsed by Americans, that they never would have understood, much less approved, a decision not to use the weapon if it was available, and that no mainline American politician, who would have been likely to be President at the time, would have decided otherwise…. He also seemed to believe that the use of the bomb, as Secretary Byrnes contended, might help him in dealing with the Soviets. But that hope was never a controlling reason but only a supplementary, and thus a confirming, reason to do what Roosevelt would probably also have done, what virtually all top-level presidential advisers seemed to endorse, and what only one adviser, Under Secretary Bard, who was on the fringes of decision-making, ever questioned before Hiroshima: dropping the bomb on Japan in order to speed a surrender. “Truman and the A-Bomb,” Journal of Military History, 62:3, p. 567\nAs I say, if there were something like a professional historical consensus, this would be it. Nobody’s happy about the bomb – Truman wasn’t either – but you won’t find hordes of historians going around accusing the Truman administration of using the bombs without military reasons in the midst of what was, after all, a brutal war in which the bombing of civilians had already been established as awful, common practice.\nWhatever the shortcomings of my profession, Mr. Kristof – and historians can be maddening – consensus on Alperovitz isn’t one of them. Please build a straw man out of someone else."

    "text": "People will commonly blame the Weimar hyperinflation for the rise to power of the Nazi party, disregarding the ten-year lag and the intervening Great Depression, an episode of severe deflation. Recently one historian set forth a “precise mechanism” for how inflation produced antisemitism:\nIt seems to me that this explanation fails on two grounds. First, unless you already associate Jews with “speculative and grasping” behavior and are prone to see them as involved in sinister conspiracies to do with money and finance—unless, that is, you are already an antisemite—there is no reason for inflation to lead to extreme antisemitism. The problem isn’t inflation, it’s antisemitism.\nSecond, if this the mechanism, then shouldn’t it be reversed by deflation? In those transactions, the author’s non-Jewish German should be grateful to have to part with less money than previously; the author’s innkeeper should be pleased to be able to buy more with his money than before; both should be happy that the groups they associate with finance and money have treated them thus . . . yes, well, I grant it’s implausible—because we’re talking about a deeply antisemitic culture. The fault lies not with rising prices, but with antisemitism.\nMoreover, of course, it’s not the Weimar hyperinflation that correlates with the increasing power of Nazism. It’s the deflation of the Great Slump, 1928 (in Germany) to 1933.\nWhich is why, of course, the economist George Warren observed at the time, “It seems to be a choice between a rise in prices or a rise in dictators.”2"

But it’s a part of the world with which most of them are unfamiliar, so there’s a need of considerable deployment of maps. In the past we’ve often used proper military maps—like the West Point ones—but to be honest these are finer-grained than our students generally like.\nStill, it’s not all that easy to make decent military maps, at least not for me. So campaigns like this one, where there’s a lot of back and forth, require some sort of in-between depiction—not quite a proper military map, but indicating the general sweep of battlefield events. I’m still working on finding the right balance.\nIn these, I’ve tried to indicate enough of the Eastern Mediterranean so students can grasp why this is an important region—I’ve got the endpoints of the Suez Canal, and Sicily is visible, indicating the potential hazard to Italy should the British gain complete control of Libya. I’ve decided not to put country names on this map, because we use them on larger maps (like this one) and students should have a sense of what major locations are by this time of the class.\nOn the other hand I have placed the names of some important cities to help discussion of what’s at stake, and where."

Petillo.1 MacArthur received half a million dollars from Philippine president Manuel Quezon in early 1942, at just about the time MacArthur changed his mind about whether Quezon should be evacuated from Corregidor. As Petillo puts it,\nPetillo is scrupulous about not imputing causality, but the timing certainly should raise eyebrows. As she says, “we must ask if MacArthur’s ‘personal ties and devotion to the Philippine nation’ were influenced by half a million dollars.” She goes on to note that Washington had been apprised about the money and supposes that the general’s superiors were concerned that without such inducements, the “angry” MacArthur might therefore “refuse to follow orders.” Although Petillo doesn’t mention it here, they had good reason to be concerned, inasmuch as MacArthur had directly defied Herbert Hoover’s orders to stand down during the Bonus Army operation in 1932, and instead proceeded to empty and burn the encampments.3 Petillo also notes that MacArthur’s decision to free Manuel Roxas in 1944, in contrast to the other members of the collaborationist regime in the Philippines, might have had something to do with Roxas’s signature appearing on the order to pay the money.\nPetillo’s discovery was not, and is not, unknown. It received coverage in the Washington Post at the time—unusual for articles in the Pacific Historical Review, estimable though that journal is. It’s also known that Dwight Eisenhower later refused a similar payment, saying he was sure it was legal, but there was significant “danger of misapprehension or misunderstanding.”\nYet MacArthur, the disobeyer of presidential orders and the taker of secret payments from foreign governments for mysterious reasons, enjoys rather a good reputation."

    "text": "Franklin Roosevelt told George VI during the king’s visit to the United States early in June 1939 that the Americans planned to control an area extending five hundred miles east of the U.S. coast, if it could use bases at Bermuda and Trinidad; by the end of the month, the president was meeting with the British ambassador, Ronald Lindsay, to formalize the request for leases at Bermuda, Trinidad, and St. Lucia.1 In retrospect we can identify these plans as an early phase of what became Admiral Stark’s Plan Dog, providing for naval assistance to the Allies in the western Atlantic. Late in July, the Army asked for bases in Trinidad and Natal, Brazil; the Navy confirmed its need of bases, and on August 24, Stark wrote Roosevelt to confirm that leases were available in Trinidad and in Bermuda, where the US Navy would take over some or all of the facilities then operated by Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways. Two days later, the Soviet news agency TASS would issue the terms of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, allocating to the USSR a “special position” in the Baltics and the division of Poland between the two; the Germans and the Soviets began the invasion of Poland shortly afterward.\nOn September 4, the day after the British declaration of war on Germany, the United States finalized leases to bases in Bermuda, Trinidad, and St. Lucia, paying a rent of $500 a year for the site in Bermuda; on September 6, Stark directed the commander of the Atlantic squadron to maintain a patrol of 300 miles offshore, and to report the movements of foreign men-of-war. Some of the destroyers thus tasked went to Newfoundland as the Grand Banks Patrol, with the acquiescence of the British government, to render assistance in emergencies and to observe and report movements of foreign warships.2\nThe Division of the American Republics in the U.S. State Department asked the Office of the Geographer to prepare maps with 300-mile radiuses laid out from the outermost limits of the American Republics, and sent that map to the White House, where the president selected the points of a zone defined by those varius circles, and returned it to the geographer with a request to neaten up the map thus defined. The Declaration of Panama, of October 2, 1939, formalized that zone.\nBritain allowed unlimited U.S. overflight of the Bahamas after the Panama Declaration. This declaration looked neutral and formally was neutral, though Roosevelt plainly intended it as a form of neutrality that would aid the Allies. As he told Lindsay’s replacement, Lord Lothian, on August 30, 1939, the declaration would allow\nWith the adoption of the Neutrality Act of 1939 in November, this shipping would include arms bound for the Allies."

Wigmore has an article of 1987 asking whether the gold panic of early 1933 was caused by fears of devaluation, to which he answers “yes.”1\nBut immediately on taking office, Roosevelt began the process of devaluing, and the panic ended. Here’s Wigmore’s own data of daily gold holdings in the New York Federal Reserve Bank, charted.\nWigmore’s argument is that Roosevelt’s immediate actions might have done something to restore confidence, but not much.\nAnd yet depositors brought much of the gold they had withdrawn back to Federal Reserve banks over the course of March—before Roosevelt’s April 5 order requiring them to do it. Indeed, as you can see from the chart, the steepest rise in gold holdings comes between the inauguration and the fireside chat.\nDuring that time, in his first presidential press conference, on March 8, 1933, Roosevelt allowed as how, according to a definition of the gold standard he pulled from the newspaper, the United States wasn’t on it at the moment, shied away from the term “controlled inflation,” and then almost immediately said,\nA reporter asked if they could print “that part—managed?” Roosevelt replied, “No, I think not.” A little later a reporter pressed him further on what he meant.\nTwo days later, when he announced the plan for reopening banks, he noted this would include all usual banking functions—\nThese press conferences are now online here as they were not when I was writing The Money Makers, in which I discuss this period.2\nIn any case, it looks as though Roosevelt was certainly letting the information get out, albeit off the record, that he wanted a permanent system of managed currency and that he wasn’t allowing gold convertibility—and yet, during that time, depositors brought an awful lot of gold back into the Federal Reserve banks. It seems to me that confidence in the new administration’s actions—the first stages of a devaluation—restored some confidence even though they constituted precisely what people were supposed to have feared."

Ganz spends some time explaining his general distaste for alternative histories asking “what if the Nazis had won,” both because it is historically implausible, given the delusional nature of Nazi ideology, and because it has a definite whiff of immorality about it.\n\n\n\nA still from Prime’s The Man in the High Castle showing the alternative-history Reichstag building.\n\n\nIn some moods I feel the same way about one of the most common tropes of World War II analysis—that is, that the German invasion of the Soviet Union was Hitler’s greatest mistake. (I was going to quote directly a well known historian saying that, here, but I had rather not pick a fight with someone generally good over repeating a commonplace; you can surely find people saying it if you really want.)\nWhy do I dislike the “mistake” formulation? I tend to agree with those theorists of history who will say that all historical analysis entails implicit counterfactuals, and that it is better to make them explicit if you want to evaluate the analysis properly. In this case, saying that Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union was a mistake entails counterfactual, usually implicit but sometimes stated outright, that had he not done it, Germany might have won the war.\nTwo related aspects of that statement trouble me. First, and perhaps less important, I also tend to agree with theorists of counterfactual analysis that if you’re going to posit an alternative path that history might have taken, you ought to identify the moment when it was at least possible. And I don’t know that anyone has ever identified a moment when Hitler could plausibly have said, well, I suppose I won’t invade the Soviet Union after all.\nWhich points us to the second, more major issue with the “mistake” formulation: from Hitler’s point of view, it was not a mistake; it was a central purpose of the German war and indeed the Nazi state to invade the USSR so as to seize, depopulate, and resettle land to the East. You can say that was a terrible idea; you can say it entailed genocidal atrocities. But it was not, for the Nazis, a mistake—it was one of the major reasons to be a Nazi.\nSaying that it was a mistake fundamentally misunderstands the nature of Nazism. There could be no German victory without that conquest of territory in the East if you were a Nazi, which of course Hitler was. Saying it was a mistake for him to invade the USSR presupposes a Hitler who could somehow have been persuaded not to do so—a Hitler who was, somehow, not a Nazi, or anyway not a sincere one. And that’s a presupposition that beggars belief."

    "text": "While doing a Reddit AMA for Myth America, in which I have a chapter on pernicious myths about the New Deal, I received a question about Murdering McKinley, reminding me that book is twenty years old this year.1 A quick glance at my c.v. told me that by a coincidence of timing, that means The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Very Short Introduction is fifteen years old, and Winter War: Hoover, Roosevelt, and the First Clash over the New Deal is five.2 These arbitrary digital anniversaries don’t mean a thing, except that we make them so, which is no reason not to. So here are some thoughts, which are mainly for me before I forget them.\nFirst, these are easily the three most popular of my books. That popularity owes to different causes. The VSI is in a well known series with a good reputation. The VSI and Winter War happened to appear shortly before moments when their topics seemed relevant (the Great Economic Unpleasantness of the late Bush administration and the Trump–Biden transition, respectively). Murdering McKinley hadn’t either of those advantages, but Brian Lamb did like it for Booknotes.\nAll three of them came out of definite ideas that then changed in significantly in the process of researching and writing, though for different reasons.\nMurdering McKinley started out of my sense that the transition from McKinley to Theodore Roosevelt was much more consequential than then-current historiography supposed, and the willingness of Thomas LeBien, then an editor at Hill and Wang, to believe I could write it relatively quickly and well. With my reading of the Vernon Briggs papers in the Massachusetts Historical Society, the book morphed into a kind of social scientific detective story. For the most part the narrative looks over Briggs’s shoulder as he tries to figure out Czolgosz’s motives. Owing to the amorphous state of psychiatry at the time, Briggs looked into a wide range of possibilities, and his investigation of Czolgosz took him in turn into almost every troubled corner of American life at around 1900. Everywhere he looked he could see motives, which in the end meant he couldn’t know what the motive was: almost every way you could say Czolgosz had suffered, so had millions of other Americans—but he was the one who pulled the trigger.\nI remain reasonably happy with the book although if I had it to do again I would give more attention to foreign policy. Czolgosz did at one point indicate dissatisfaction with the hypocrisy of US colonization of the Philippines (among the many other aspects of American society with which he was unhappy), and given that the book came out just as the Iraq War was beginning, it would have been a useful time for historical reflection on that episode.\nThe Very Short Introduction came about because Oxford University Press editor Susan Ferber asked me if I’d like to do a VSI on the Great Depression. I had just done Blessed Among Nations which, with Murdering McKinley, established that I was willing to write about matters like the tariff and the gold standard and the mess left of the US economy after the Great War. Susan must have thought that caring about all that stuff was a good qualification for writing about the slump of 1929–1933, even if I hadn’t yet written directly about that period. I wanted to do it because I was then thinking about writing a book that would end with the 1930s, so it would be useful to me.\nThe VSI series was already well established in the British headquarters of OUP, but this was going to be one of the first volumes commissioned by the US office, and there was some uncertainty about format—whether it would have scholarly apparatus, and so forth—but the key thing was, it would be Very Short, as the titles indicate. There was a strict word count, which I don’t remember, but it was small; nevertheless I had barely thought about it before I went back to Susan and said I wanted it to cover the New Deal as well as the Great Depression. She said yes: as long as I stuck within the word count.\nThe book reflects the state of historiography at the time and I would certainly write it differently if I could write it now. But maybe then it wouldn’t be as popular. I was determined to integrate as much of the history of the New Deal done in departments of economics as I could with the history done in departments of history, and that led to a book that did indeed have perhaps more to say about tariffs and the gold standard and public works policies than most. It reflects the good work done by then-beginning historians of the New Deal, like Andrew W. Cohen, Meg Jacobs, and Jason Scott Smith.\nIt also reflects the interpretations of the two major New Deal historians of the 1990s, Alan Brinkley and David M. Kennedy. And while including Brinkley’s observations about the broader possibilities of the 1930s, and Kennedy’s insistence on the continuity between the New Deal and the war, I wanted to go a bit further in crediting the New Deal itself; so much of the literature aimed at what it hadn’t done. So my contribution, I thought, was to emphasize—and expand a bit—John Kenneth Galbraith’s concept of countervailing power. The New Deal not only supported labor unions, but also workers, consumers, and farmers more broadly, as well as ill developed regions like the South and the intermountain West, and so forth, in rebalancing unbalanced markets; that was more than security—that was a lasting structural effect.\nI got some comments about the VSI from established New Deal historians, who said various versions of “I couldn’t have written about it that succinctly,” which I chose to take as a compliment.\nI also thought I should keep Franklin D. Roosevelt out of it as much as possible. I was not—and still don’t think I am—a presidential historian, and I understood the New Deal (like Progressivism) to result from much broader forces than the election of a single person. Still, those elections and those persons matter in funneling or focusing those factors. So you’ve got to talk about presidents and presidencies, even if you don’t want them to dominate the narrative unduly. Roosevelt scarcely appears in the VSI as a force in himself until the last chapter, which I think is probably a good way at least to begin thinking about the New Deal—as a product of long-pent forces released and given focus by his election, rather than the product of the Roosevelt White House per se—though ultimately one does have to reckon with him, just as Americans at the time did.\nThat need to reckon with what Roosevelt did, and didn’t, do led to Winter War. I worked on it with Lara Heimert at Basic Books, who had also edited my previous book, The Money Makers, about Roosevelt’s repeated reliance on monetary policy from 1933–1945. In the course of writing that book I became persuaded that, contrary to a lot of commentary, Roosevelt had a clear agenda going into November 1932 and that his actions between election and inauguration had to do with protecting and furthering that agenda. As with Murdering McKinley, I made a good archival find that enabled greater insight into Roosevelt’s campaign and embryonic administration. During some research at the Hoover Institution, I found some correspondence of Robert Jackson—not the later Supreme Court justice and Nuremberg prosecutor, but the political operator—in which Jackson mentioned his diary; I was able pretty easily to find the diary was archived at his alma mater, Dartmouth. And it contained some terrific material on how the campaign functioned, and what it was like to work with Roosevelt and his inner circle. Using that and the diaries of some Hoover aides—Edgar Rickard, Theodore Joslin, James MacLafferty—as well as that of Raymond Moley’s secretary, Celeste Jedel, I had a pretty good picture of the Democratic and Republican camps.\nRoosevelt liked to compare himself to a football quarterback: he knew where he needed to go, and the rules for getting there, but whether he might pass, hand off, or run the ball himself remained open, and he liked to keep his options open until the last possible second. It seemed to me an apt comparison, in its emphasis on shifting tactics and even strategy, but clear ultimate aims.3 He viewed the New Deal as a program to reinvigorate and improve democracy in the United States—reinvigorating and improving the economy was a first step in that direction, and it had to be done in a way that was broadly beneficial if people were to begin to trust Washington, DC, again. And from the start, he and his aides saw the New Deal in the context of a world where democracy was under threat; as Jackson wrote just before Roosevelt took office,\nI got some nice feedback from established Roosevelt biographers, and some historians seem to feel it helped them reconceptualize the New Deal and the administration’s relationship to its constituencies, which is gratifying. I hope it continues to appeal to students of the New Deal. It certainly informed how I wrote about the New Deal in my next book—but Why the New Deal Matters doesn’t have a neat anniversary this year, so I’ll have to reflect on it another time."

    "text": "Ben Mathis-Lilley of Slate asked me if I would talk to him a bit about whether women voters brought progressivism to the United States (or, as some would say, ruined the country), so I said, “sure.”\nWomen voted much as men did, but in smaller numbers, up until 1980 or so—when men suddenly skewed far more conservative. So really, the thing that needs explaining is why men voters should have proved so volatile, so emotional, so unpredictable when Ronald Reagan appeared on the scene.\nThat doesn’t mean people don’t believe women have, and had, a special interest in voting certain ways, but that belief has varied over time. You might instinctively think that women would be more pro-welfare. The Republican congress and president who supported the Sheppard-Towner Act of 1921 probably did think that. Harriet Frothingham’s case told them otherwise and the existence of vocal, politically active, conservative women probably helped ensure the Sheppard-Towner Act’s demise.\nIn the 1932 election, the Democrats had a women’s division headed by Molly Dewson, whose team put out flyers that told voters about the New Deal—but she kept the women’s division name off them, to avoid prejudicing men who read them. Dewson believed there was no such thing as women’s issues per se, and warned Franklin Roosevelt, “Franklin, if you ever mortify me by making a speech specifically addressed to women I shall never forgive you.”1\nIt was common to believe that women would vote for Herbert Hoover, though: he was supposed to have a rapport with them owing to his time as Food Administrator, as Mathis-Lilley notes. Henry Wallace wrote in mid-October, “The thing I am really afraid of in this election is the woman vote. I am afraid that it is too late to do anything about the women.”2 Hoover aides thought similarly; one especially optimistic one wrote at the start of November, “It is still possible to carry California, the wonderful favorable reaction to Hoover’s speech and the unfavorable reaction to the Roosevelt speech, plus Shuler, plus the women, all will save the day here” (they didn’t).3\nMolly Dewson was probably right in 1932 that women would consider the issues much as men did, though we don’t have sophisticated polling data to tell us so."

    "text": "This is a follow-up to the previous post on Roosevelt’s assessment of the German threat in December 1940, pursuing the big question, “How much of a threat did Germany pose to the United States before Pearl Harbor?” This post looks at the question of Atlantic geography and German ambitions.\nLet’s consider the Atlantic situation at the time of Roosevelt’s speech at the end of 1940.\nYou can see the short distance from Brazil to West Africa; you can also see that French West Africa was at the time under the jurisdiction of the Vichy regime. France had fallen to Germany in June; Italy had entered the war and struck across North Africa. Though the Italians had failed to take Egypt and were then suffering under British counter-attack, the Germans would shortly organize the Afrika Corps under Erwin Rommel and deploy it to the region.2\nThe status of West Africa was thus anything but evidently secure at the end of 1940, and indeed would only seem less secure quite soon.\nEven as Roosevelt was warning that the Americas were vulnerable to German assault across the Atlantic, Hitler was planning for such an attack. In response to the Roosevelt administration’s September 1940 agreement to trade US destroyers for British bases in the western hemisphere, Hitler told Admiral Raeder that “England-USA must be thrown out of North-West Africa.” He opened negotiations with Spain to trade French Morocco for one of the Canary Islands, to establish a military outpost in the far West of the European hemisphere; he also began to consider whether the Azores could be used “to carry out aerial attacks from a land base against the United States.” German bomber technology would not then support it but nobody could then know of the limits on even the longest-range German bombers then under development, the Heinkel 177.3\nIn the period between the fall of France and Pearl Harbor, Germany appeared to be at peak power, to Germans and to outside observers alike. Through 1941, aware of the impending Japanese attack, Hitler would continue to plan for a German war on the United States, in which an assault across the Atlantic would play a part.4 There is thus no obvious reason to believe that Roosevelt was wrong, or alarmist, to consider the relative narrowness of the ocean or the possibility of a German aerial assault across its expanse."

    "text": "Hasselwander noted that historians will sometimes say or suggest that Lt. Fraatz, commander of U 652, might have mistaken Greer for one of the Wickes-class destroyers the US traded to Britain in exchange for Western-hemisphere bases in the deal of September 1940, and thus a legitimate target; Hasselwander specifically cites Kurt Assman to this effect (Nur Assmann erklärt, daß der Kommandant geglaubt habe, sein Verfolger sei einer der fünfzig amerikanischen Zerstörer, welche die Vereinigten Staaten ab September 1940 Großbritannienüberlassen hatten.).1 I’ll have more to say about destroyers-for-bases another time; for now, I’ll give this post over to a discussion of this possibility of mistaken identity.\nYou can see above a photograph of the Greer and a photograph of one of her sister ships traded to Britain, which became HMS Newmarket. The question of whether Greer might have looked like one of these newly British ships was raised within a couple weeks of the incident, and Time magazine took it up, explaining that the Greer had been modified and therefore looked different from other, once-similar destroyers. It’s true, I think, that you can see this in these photos if you look: the forward stack has been changed, with a “spark screen” added; the stacks have been lowered, too. The guns are different. And of course, so is the livery. Moreover, Time noted, the Greer was sailing on its own, as British destroyers did not. It was, as we have seen, broad daylight—that is why Fraatz did not surface.\nStill, I would concede that the two ships look quite similar and if I were looking through a U-boat periscope I might well not be able to tell the difference. Hasselwander notes further that there is no indication Fraatz thought he was looking at a British destroyer. (Die verfügbaren Teile des Logbuchs von U652 deuten jedoch darauf hin, daß die Ähnlichkeit von Greer mit den England überlassenen Zerstörern Fraatz nicht aufgefallen ist.)2\nMoreover, to repeat again what we noted in the earlier post, Fraatz did notice that the Greer was not acting like a British destroyer, given its “hesitating behavior” („zögernde Verhalten,“ Hasselwander is quoting Fraatz). Hasselwander goes on to suggest that Fraatz didn’t mean the torpedoes to sink the ship, but rather intended them as a (momentarily successful) effort to throw the Greer off his trail (Die geringe Entfernung, auf die U 652 seinen zweiten Torpedo schoß, und die anscheinend überstürzte Art, in der dies geschah, lassen vermuten, daß Fraatz seinen Angriff hauptsächlich als Ablenkungsmanöver gedacht hatte, um seinen Verfolger abzuschütteln. Tatsächlich gelang es ja U 652, bis 15.07 h weitere Horchkontakte zu vermeiden).3\nWe should not, it seems to me, throw out this suggestion absent evidence. But also, it is a bit of a red herring. Roosevelt’s argument about the appropriate US response to the incident did not hinge on the U-boat captain’s knowing that the Greer was a US ship."

The army and navy wanted a network of coastal bases to assure access to Natal, in the eastern part of Brazil—at the narrowest point of the Atlantic. The administration determined that signing a deal with Pan Am would be quicker than undertaking any more formal process, and as Congress had given Roosevelt a discretionary fund of $34 million for such purposes on June 11 in the naval appropriations act, it was swiftly done.1 According to General George Marshall, these airfields were “more essential to out national defense than any other single matter.”2\nThese bases would not, for the most part, be the bases acquired from Britain in trade for old US destroyers, though Pan Am played a small part in setting up the base in Trinidad. These would be new bases, in which Pan Am had its own interest—it wanted a network of runways that would suit the new stratoliner, the first passenger aircraft with a pressurized cabin, which shared components with the B-17.\nSettling on locations for the bases entailed some difficulties. The planners wanted one in Martinique, but the island’s Vichy proclivities made that impossible. The Vichy governor in French Guiana was a bit more obliging and worked with Pan Am in secret—until the Nazis kicked him out.\nAlthough Pan Am made a slow start, the airfields ultimately proved vital, especially in managing traffic to and from Europe bound through Natal. Moreover, as Marshall said in April 1941, the network constituted an investment: “an asset to us for military use and for future trade relations. Anything we can do now toward providing airfields is an enduring thing and not a venture.”3"

    "text": "President Herbert Hoover was no progressive; the New Deal did not begin under his administration nor in a fantasy alternate history where he won reelection would he have implemented anything resembling a New Deal. You might think it unnecessary to say such things, given the vituperation Hoover directed at the New Deal in the 1932 election, or his record in office.1 But there are a number of historians who argue President Hoover was kind of a proto-New Dealer, much misunderstood; to the contrary, he was well on the conservative side of his own party.2\nThis view is not unique to me, but is commonly held among people who have spent any amount of time with Hoover’s own papers. See for example Elliot A. Rosen:\nOr consider William E. Leuchtenburg’s case.\nI believe you can tell in both cases that the writers are irked by having to say these things; I think in part because their own early works were, and are, often cited to support the case they are here methodically refuting. Notably, Rosen had worked with Raymond Moley, who credited the Hoover administration with originating what the conservative Moley later regarded as the good parts of the New Deal.6\nIt’s worth highlighting Leuchtenburg’s point: Hoover steadfastly resisted policies that would look like the later New Deal, but that doesn’t mean people in his administration and his party didn’t propose them. Hoover opposed publicly owned and operated electricity, championed by Republican Senator George Norris of Nebraska. Hoover opposed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and, once it was created, limited its operation; it was the creature of his own Fed chair, Eugene Meyer. Hoover, as Leuchtenburg says, opposed the recommendations of his own commissions on unemployment, including the one headed by AT&T CEO Walter Gifford. Hoover actively opposed or by indifference killed a lot of the more creative ideas his subordinates proposed. He declined to pursue the activist monetary policy Adolph Miller, the longest-serving member of the Federal Reserve, proposed to him—leaving Miller no choice to propose the same policy to the much more receptive Franklin Roosevelt.7\nAlthough in my view she concedes a bit too much to the “proto-New Dealer” party on the way to this point, I think Lisa McGirr gets Hoover right:\nProhibition, tariffs, immigration restriction and deportation were fine with Hoover; economic development, relief of unemployment, or activist monetary policy, not so much.\nWhy do people tend to say otherwise? This to me is the most frustrating question ever asked in a historiographical debate, the demand that you account for why other people are wrong. I will note that while Rosen cites “academicians,” one wing of the “Hoover, proto-New Dealer” faction is the decidedly non-academic group of conservative activists who want to blame the Great Depression on government intervention of any and all kinds.9 But another source—and, I think, the reason Leuchtenburg and Rosen’s earlier work is implicated in it—is the mid-century consensus historiography that sought to minimize and tame the political conflicts that characterized American history."

They have a car and (robot; don’t ask) driver; they discuss how they can get there from here.\nLike much Muppet humor, this joke asks the viewer to have a knowledge of show business tropes, of which “travel by map” is one. Many of us will probably associate it with Indiana Jones; here’s what we see when, in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy leaves Marshall College (University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA in real life and apparently fictionally located in Northern California as well) to find Marian in Nepal, traveling by flying boat.\nOf course, as with the Muppets, much that is in Indiana Jones is pastiche and homage, and the travel by map sequence serves the same purpose here as it did thirty years later: nudging the viewer to say see, this is like those old-timey movies. But which ones?\nThe best known example I can think of is Casablanca. At the beginning, the narrator tells us about the refugee trail that leads people fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe to the Vichy-controlled city. As he talks, we see their path, shifting from globe to map.\nI don’t know where this trope originated but I wouldn’t be surprised to learn it came from, or became common during, the years around World War II. As Susan Schulten points out, more Americans saw more maps of more kinds because of the war. Many had never before been overseas or even had to think about it much.1\nCasablanca of course dramatizes the American journey from isolation to intervention in the character arc of Rick Blaine. Maybe it’s also the first real popular instance of the geographical awareness that made that arc possible."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Historians often rely on Raymond Moley’s memoirs for accounts of the early New Deal.1 I have been skeptical of leaning too hard on these sources: memoirs written after the fact are fallible because memory is fallible; moreover, Moley left the administration because he disagreed with Roosevelt’s policies and he came to disagree with them even more, ultimately contributing to Barry Goldwater’s speeches, and so this rupture colored his recollection. But most of all, his memoirs are like all memoirs “intentional,” to use Marc Bloch’s term; as historians we generally prefer sources that serve as “witnesses in spite of themselves.” That is, Moley (like all memoirists) composed his memoirs and in that act of composition made decisions in keeping with his intentions, seeking to influence historical narrative. We’d rather have a document written in 1933 whose author didn’t necessarily mean it to see the light of day, which was supposed to communicate something of importance in 1933, and which therefore unintentionally bears witness when we look at it now.2\nI was able to look at Moley’s papers in the Hoover Institution at Stanford some years ago. They are full of witnesses in spite of themselves, but they also include evidence of Moley’s intention to shape the historical record, which is perhaps more than anything else what put me on alert as to his reliability. Notably, Moley’s papers include the diary of his assistant, Celeste Jedel, covering January 1 to August 1, 1933—essentially, the short period when Moley was of at least some consequence to the Roosevelt administration. Moley directed that this diary be kept sealed until 1976, and included a covering memorandum to researchers, which he wrote in 1972 on his Phoenix, Arizona, stationery.\nThis note says a lot, I think, especially when read together with the diary and with knowledge of Moley’s general attitude toward the early Roosevelt administration. Moley really seems to want to have it both ways: the diary belongs in his papers because he directed it be written but also it includes things he didn’t say should go in it. He didn’t agree with what she said but she was brilliant and had a photographic memory. Also the entries are all correct! I think one can parse this passage so that these things are all true at once, but it requires hard work, and it also requires you to believe that Moley’s grasp of the past from forty years onward be better than Jedel’s contemporary commentary. It is much more likely that Moley in 1972 was uncomfortable with some of the candid, and true, observations that Jedel made in 1933, which often include tart evaluations of other people in the administration, not all of which seem to a judicious historian at all inconsistent with what we know of Moley’s opinions.\nWhether the historian reading Moley’s covering note accepts, a historian should certainly understand it as an indication that Moley remained, decades later, deeply concerned with how he appeared in 1933. He wanted that moment remembered, to be sure, because it was the moment when he was nearest to power and maybe exercised a little of it. But also he wanted it remembered in a particular way; he was ambivalent later about what he did and said then. Which is maybe no different than any other historical figure, but Moley’s note serves as an unusually express reminder to the historian to take care with Moley’s intentional versions of the historical record."

There are practical reasons, having to do with not keeping large data files lying around; there are also principled reasons, having to do with reproducible research and adherence to community standards.\nI learned to do this mainly by taking Kieran Healy’s invaluable Data Wrangling and Data Visualization course, online.\nI am, I hope, as sensitive as anyone to historians’ need to consult archival and arcane resources and I love the library as much as anyone. But if a reasonably authoritative chart or map for teaching can be made from community resources, it probably should be.\nSo here’s an example; I often like to show something like the comparative impact of the Great Depression. You could go to the library and look in International Historical Statistics and type information by hand into a spreadsheet—and I wouldn’t want to stop you.

    "title": "What did U.S. Voters Want from the New Deal in 1932?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I published an article in 2019 arguing that “the New Deal was on the ballot in 1932”—that is, that Roosevelt “ran on the New Deal and was elected on it; while 1933 predates modern polling, we may suppose that the voters had a reasonable expectation he would deliver it.”1 My view is contrary to a conventional wisdom which held that Roosevelt did not say much of consequence about the New Deal. I argue that the much tougher burden of proof lies with people who want to prove a negative—that Roosevelt didn’t say anything about key elements of the New Deal—and if you can point to speeches in which he did say things—about support for massively increased public works programs, or stock market regulation, or a lower tariff—then it’s pretty clear where one should come down on the question. But I didn’t have direct evidence about what voters thought, just what Roosevelt said and how vehemently Hoover opposed it.\nAs it turns out, at about the same time as my article appeared in Modern American History, a scholar named Helmut Norpoth published an article in PS discussing an internal poll conducted by the market research firm J. David Houser for the Hoover campaign close to the 1932 election and arguing that its results show\nIt’s well known among scholars of public opinion polling that market research was closely related to the infant industry, and you can find a discussion of that in standard works.3 So it’s quite reasonable to treat a survey conducted by a market resarch company as a kind of proto-opinion poll.\nYou would want to be careful, though. Looking at the poll, the author notes,\nFigure 4, cited there, shows that among the “FDR Defectors,” 13 percent were unemployed, while among “Hoover Loyalists,” 8 percent were unemployed. The thing is, this was at a time when the unemployment rate, as best we can estimate, was around 23 percent.5 So it seems quite likely that the Houser respondents did not represent the overall populace—they were much less likely to be unemployed—and that characterizing their views as representative of “the majority of Americans” is unwarranted; certainly characterizing their experiences as showing who was affected personally by the Depression seems unwarranted. They suffered much less than the average American and we may suppose their attitudes diverged correspondingly from those of the average American.\nAt the same time, it’s useful to note what they did want from the government. I reproduce the article’s next chart, figure 5, here.\nNote that, as the author says, hardly anyone—FDR defector or Hoover loyalist—favored giving money to the unemployed or a government takeover of business. Neither Hoover nor Roosevelt favored these, either. Slightly over half of FDR defectors favored paying the veterans’ bonus, as against only sixteen percent of Hoover loyalists; Hoover emphatically opposed the bonus and, infamously, sent the army to burn out the bonus marchers’ encampment and tear gas the protesters, probably causing the death of an infant. Roosevelt didn’t support paying the bonus either (though, as he privately noted, he didn’t think the marchers ought to be gassed) but eventually the Democratic congress would vote for it and pass it over his veto.6\nMore interesting, though, note what the FDR defectors favored by large margins: a lower tariff (56 percent), stock market regulation (67 percent), and spending more on public works (77 percent). And there’s clear daylight between FDR defectors and Hoover loyalists on these issues—just as there was clear daylight between Roosevelt and Hoover on the stump. Inasmuch as these issues—along with repeal of Prohibition—were key elements of the New Deal featured in Roosevelt’s speeches and campaign literature (as I discussed in the 2019 article), it seems like the New Deal messaging did get through to voters."

New Deal, so I took the opportunity to talk about how the Roosevelt administration used public works programs for political and ideological ends. That is, Roosevelt’s concept of a sample publicly owned facility as a “yardstick,” to determine fair pricing and operating procedures, was ideological; the use of a sufficiently large public works program to influence labor standards, wage practices, and the legitimacy of unions was an ideological purpose; Roosevelt’s own statement that direct employment would “help restore the close relationship with the people which is necessary to preserve our democratic form of government” was ideological, reflecting his view that public works programs could help to reverse the alienation endemic to the modern condition.1\nMoreover, the ubiquity of public works designed to foster community and edifying leisure pursuits constituted an ideological commitment to establish a right to the good life for everyone, regardless of station.\nAll of that constituted an imperative to design for democracy, more or less; I also discussed the way that the TVA in particular exemplified an imperative to design for sustainability.\nYou can see some of the visuals I assembled to argue the case on the slides."

    "text": "The effort to quantify the dead of the Holocaust inspires a queasy feeling, as of dealing with the genuinely obscene, but it is a necessary methodological substitute for the evidentiary absence at the center of the event: that is to say, we have no representative subjective account of it. That is to say, we have survivors’ accounts but, as Primo Levi (among others) points out, survivors’ accounts are not representative. The representative Jewish experience of the Holocaust was death.\nIt is a shocking thing to consider: that, for example, of the 3.3 million Jews who lived in Poland in 1939, perhaps 380,000 survived the war. Historians generally use first-hand testimony of great historical events as an indication of what it must have been like to experience the event. A survivor’s testimony cannot serve that purpose when the dead outnumber the survivors by something like 7.6 to 1."

No, but\nHe goes on to note that the often cited argument by Ohanian is “unpersuasive,” inasmuch as—for all its shortcomings—the NRA did do its part in “arresting deflation” and anyway in no way constitutes the whole of the New Deal.4\nField concludes—this is 2009—that Barack Obama’s key advisors, notably Lawrence Summers and Tim Geithner, “have been too deferential toward Wall Street.” And he likens “New Deal denialism, as some have called it,” to creationism; that is, that it has no more proper relation to economics as a science than creationism does to biology.5\nAnyway, it seems like a good enough reason to put up the latest version of a graph I commonly use, depicting U.S. business cycles over the course of the interwar period, using the monthly series of the index of industrial production. The collapse of 1929–1933 is obvious, as is the sharp turn-around in March 1933, and the improvement over the course of the New Deal, with the exception of the 1937–1938 recession."

    "section": "",
    "text": "People sometimes ask, “what professional opinion of yours is most likely to have you like—”\nHere’s my answer: scholars of US foreign policy have been far too generous in their treatment of interwar opponents of anti-Nazi foreign policy as proposed and practiced by the Roosevelt administration. I can understand the logic: there is ample reason to oppose many instances of US overseas militarism after 1945; none would have been possible without World War II, which created the modern US military state and the intellectual framework that supports it; therefore the creation of that state and framework must have been a mistake and further, the opponents of it must have had good ideas.\nI’ll use this post to lay out the basic problem by looking at an essay by a, if not the, preeminent New Left historian of US foreign policy, writing about a, if not the, preeminent opponent of Franklin Roosevelt’s way of thinking.\nWriting in 1970, William A. Williams complained that “Izzy Stone” too-frequently compared President Richard Nixon to Herbert Hoover; if both were Quakers, Williams said, “there we have a case of no difference with a fantastic distinction.”1 The remark shows how little Williams understood Hoover, or Nixon: In 1930, President Hoover authorized Lewis Strauss to use “the services of any one of our various government secret services” to secure documents indicating how Democratic politicians planned to criticize him. Strauss tasked an agent of the Office of Naval Intelligence to break into a Democratic Party headquarters in search of such documents. Four decades later, Nixon would do something similar with less-capable burglars and get caught. Hoover and Nixon had in common the belief they could use the sinews of government for their own purposes, whatever the law said.2\nThey shared this belief in part because they believed they were on the right side of a great moral battle; Hoover and Nixon thought the New Deal had let into government “a stream of treason”—that was Hoover’s phrase, when he wrote Nixon to congratulate him for bringing Alger Hiss to book.3\nI mention this because I want to point out how ill-informed was Williams’s enthusiasm for Hoover. Williams liked Herbert Hoover because he thought “Hoover was against The Empire.” One of the twentieth century’s foremost scholars of the history of US foreign policy, which he understood as the history of a specific kind of imperialism, Williams helped to rehabilitate Hoover and other Republicans of the interwar period by claiming them for his cause. They too opposed US imperialism, for which they were vilified by historians in the business of “levitating Godfather Franklin.”4\nRoosevelt wanted to increase US military and diplomatic power because he opposed the rise of Nazi Germany, among other aggressor powers. Hoover was more bothered by the New Deal than by Nazism; he thought of them as two sides of the same coin, and the New Deal was here, which Nazism was not.\nThe Nazis posed no threat to anyone outside Germany, Hoover thought: “they have no desire to dominate any but their own race.” And the inevitability of counterattack precluded a European war. “Europe is all cheek by jowl, they can reprise pretty easy . . . which will neutralize any danger of attack.”5\nIn my view Hoover, and by extension Williams, was wrong about all these things: I think the New Deal did much not only to preserve what existed of US democracy, but to extend it, and also to oppose fascism. I think the Nazis posed a threat to people other than Germans. And I think the inevitability of counterattack did not rule out a European war.\nWilliams by contrast regarded Hoover’s focus on opposition to the New Deal as “so right it shakes you.” Moreover, Williams firmly believed the essence of Hoover’s foreign policy was that “he recognized the necessity for nonimperial—and anti-imperial—action.”6\nExactly how Williams’s analysis would square Hoover’s acribed anti-imperialism with his relative indifference to the establishment of a Nazi empire in Europe and Africa remains unclear. As is often, if not invariably, the case with historians who seek to rehabilitate opponents of Roosevelt’s anti-Nazi foreign policy, Williams does not say what he thinks would have happened to those under Nazi rule, or to the United States, in an alternate history where Hoover remained the architect of US foreign policy.\nWilliams’s understanding of Hoover has long since been undermined by the contents of the archives, but that would have been all right by him:\nI fear that much scholarly sympathy for the interwar isolationists is about as soundly supported.8"

    "section": "",
    "text": "David Irving sued the historian Deborah Lipstadt for libel in 1996, and lost in 2000, when an English judge’s opinion held that Lipstadt was justified in her characterization of Irving in her book Denying the Holocaust. It was one of the most exciting and high-stakes things to happen to historiography during my professional career; that I happened to be teaching history in England at the time magnified it as an event in my imagination.\nLipstadt wrote a book about it, History on Trial, but in this post I want to focus on the books written by historians called to give expert opinions in the case, because it seems to me they were asked to do something unusual for professional historians, but perhaps helpful.\nFor a while I used to assign graduate students Richard Evans’s Telling Lies About Hitler because it echoed his title Telling the Truth About History, and tied into his broader concerns about the historical profession.1 But I came to feel that this feature, which attracted me, was making the book less good for graduate students; Evans may perhaps assume too much of readers, expecting them to know his particular position regarding evidence and argumentation, and to be too aware of the arguments he opposes.\nBut what his book has, and shares with the others, is an awareness that what the trial asked of historians is not what ordinary scholarship asks of historians—although maybe it should: an aggressively forensic approach to developing the evidence for a case and establishing, point by point, the narrative we know. As Robert Jan van Pelt says in his book,\nIn the crucible of a legal case, what we think we know must be, if not discarded, then picked carefully apart to rediscover its basis. Van Pelt’s book, The Case for Auschwitz, seems to me now the most useful of the three, because he explicitly develops the nature of the problem he, and other expert witnesses, faced. He returns—as I think one should—to Marc Bloch for a discussion of the nature of evidence and historical proof.\nThe third expert book that is of occasional use to me as a teacher is Peter Longerich’s Unwritten Order, about Hitler’s personal role in the Holocaust. Perhaps we have no document reading, “Dear Heinrich and Reinhard, Please go ahead and kill all the Jews, like we discussed. Kisses, Adolf.” But there is copious evidence of Hitler’s involvement in the evolution of the Final Solution.3 And this is a question students, perhaps immersed in “just-asking-questions” internet forums or worse, sometimes pose in class.\nKarl Jaspers has what I think is a funny line:\nBut as these books show, there is nothing automatic about the best expert opinions."

As with many other Depression-fighting ideas floated in the Hoover administration, the homestead program was a moderately good one, came from people well down in the bureaucracy, was underfunded, and proceeded without haste despite urgent need owing to disinterest at the level of the cabinet and the White House. It took two years after Congress appropriated the money even to begin operations. The New Deal got it going in earnest, though.\nIt was also, on its own, going to be inadequate; Crucian farmers wouldn’t get very far growing sugar without a local market for their product,1 and for that, they needed the Virgin Islands Company. An agency of the New Deal, the Virgin Islands Company provided a guaranteed purchaser for sugar grown on St. Croix (and made a bunch of it into rum, though that’s another story).\nAnyway: the homestead program and the Virgin Islands Company were, as one administrator’s memo we found in the St. Croix Landmarks Society archives explained, “complementary” operations. By itself, the homestead program wasn’t going to get very far: with the guaranteed government purchaser, it provided substantial primary or supplementary income to small-scale farmers. Documents in the National Archives give good examples of the more than four hundred homesteaders—ninety percent of whom were Black Crucians; the rest were Puerto Ricans who had come to St. Croix at least two years before—who did well out of the program.2"

    "text": "As previously noted, Admiral Harold “Betty” Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, wrote the “Plan Dog” memo on November 12, 1940, advocating a joint US-UK naval strategy against Germany in the Atlantic. The president invited the British to come to Washington for joint staff conversations on December 2, 1940.1 But before that—on November 28—Stark, as Chief of Naval Operations, issued an order to ensure practical preparedness for Anglo-American cooperation: he asked the New York Navy Yard to manufacture twenty sets of Royal Navy signal flags, for use by US warships needing to communicate with their British counterparts.2\nThe US navy and the British navy used different sets of signal flags, so for an American destroyer, say, to communicate with its British counterpart would require the use of a common language.3 Stark decided therefore that US ships should be issued with sets of British flags and pennants, and extra fabric to repair them. In February 1941, after the staff conferences, Stark increased the order from twenty to one hundred, fifty to be stored in New York and fifty in Norfolk, for issue to ships on the Atlantic squadron.4 By April they were available for distribution; on May 6, the USS Greer received its set from the supply ship USS Prairie.5\nThe president had long since articulated a vision of hemispheric defense, which would involve de facto assistance to Britain. On February 27, 1941—in, as it happens, a speech to the Oscars—he reminded listeners of this hemispheric policy and made explicit the implicit link to a broader defense:\nIn March, Lend Lease passed Congress; on April 25, the administration declared the “patrol” being conducted by US Navy ships looking for aggressor activity would be extended, though Roosevelt said the United States was still not, per se, conducting convoys. But:\nOr, perhaps, use its new signal flags to communicate the presence of a German vessel to the Royal Navy. Three weeks after the Greer received its set of British signal flags, the president declared an unlimited national emergency, in which the naval patrol would play a vital part."

    "text": "The Roosevelt administration considered a series of methods to improve an obstructionist federal judiciary in the 1930s; its best known was the Judicial Reform Bill of 1937, which sought to increase the membership of the federal bench, but before that officials seriously considered the idea of “jurisdiction stripping,” or removing the Court’s right to hear certain kinds of cases.\nThe US constitution, in Article III, grants only limited original jurisdiction to the Court—that is, cases in which the Court is the first resort. So for example, disputes between states come in the first place before the Supreme Court. It appellate jurisdiction—that is, cases that can come to the Court for appeal after decision elsewhere—is broader, including “all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under the Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority”—but “with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.”\nThis latter clause has been interpreted by the Court to allow Congress to remove certain classes of cases from the Court’s purview. The preeminent example was Ex Parte McCardle of 1868.\nOfficers of the Department of Justice considered this possibility fraught for various reasons but chiefly for a practical one:\nOne has only to look at recent, conflicting decisions in federal districts to see this problem in action, such as in 2014 when the Sixth Circuit upheld bans on marrying someone of the same gender, while other courts upheld it; absent a final court of appeal, there might be no way to resolve such a conflict. This concern prevailed within the Roosevelt administration, which turned to expansion instead.\nScholars since then have suggested what Samuel Moyn calls “channeling” or “fine-tuning” jurisdiction, including requiring by statute a super-majority on the Court for invalidating a federal statute, or reassigning final jurisdiction for invalidating a federal statute to Congress itself, which would have to ratify a Supreme Court decision to strike down a federal law."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The September 4, 1941, U-boat attack on the Greer was materially inconsequential, but symbolically vital, and to understand why, we have to think about this particular moment in the war. In this post we will look at this moment in Nazi strategy, just a couple months after the start of Operation Barbarossa, the German assault on the Soviet Union. Although the conclusion of David Stahel is pretty well established—that is to say, that by August the collapse of Barbarossa was already determined; that the failure to put resources into the construction of railroads and other logistical necessities spelled catastrophe—we should remember that even if to us, the tanks racing East look foolishly disconnected from the infantry that could secure their advances, at the time, they looked like the irresistible advance guard of yet another successful Blitzkrieg. As Stahel notes, the British Joint Intelligence Committee thought the Germans would win within six weeks; in the US, Secretary of War Stimson and General George Marshall believed it would take Germany one to three months to defeat the Soviet Union.1\nAnd the Nazi high command, Hitler in particular, thought the same. Victory in the East was certain and imminent, which meant that the German navy need only stay its hand briefly before launching war on the United States.\nAccording to Holger Herwig, Hitler told Admiral Erich Raeder to plan for a fleet of ten “superbattleships” by 1944, for war on Britain, the United States, or both. The Ziel Plan, or Z-Plan, drafted in 1939, sketched out the development of this Navy and, Herwig notes, the plan was modified in 1940 specifically for war on the United States, when Hitler “took an active interest in selecting future Atlantic bases, preferring Iceland, the Azores, the Cape Verdes, and the Canaries”; this in the flush of victory after the fall of France and “with an eye to the future war with America,” as of October 29, 1940.2 Herwig tells us that Raeder and Hitler viewed this plan differently; Raeder thought of it as an alternative to the war with the USSR, while Hitler—who was ideologically committed to the acquisition of lebensraum in the East and the killing of the people currently living there—thought of it as a consequence to the war with the Soviet Union.3\nTherefore Hitler instructed Raeder repeatedly to avoid any incident with the United States, if only for the time being. Herwig has Hitler saying so as early as May 1941. In June, the day before Barbarossa, Hitler told Raeder, “avoid every incident with the United States until ‘Barbarossa’ unfolded itself. After a few weeks the situation would be cleared up.” In July, with the US occupation of Iceland, Raeder and the naval staff requested “immediate armed assault on all USA ships within our publicly proclaimed war zone.” Hitler did continue planning operations in Gibraltar and Northwest Africa to establish an “offensive stance against America” but also repeated his order to wait for outright operations against the United States until the campaign in the East had reached its successful conclusion. He repeated this order again on August 22.4\nAt the time of the Greer attack, Hitler and his naval commanders anticipated a war, soon, against the United States. The navy was eager for it and restrained only by Hitler’s belief that it must wait on the imminent victory against the USSR (which came, even to Hitler, to seem less imminent by the end of August, if still within reach)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Earlier I posted a bare-bones, “just-the-facts” narrative of the Greer incident, from Samuel Eliot Morison’s account. Here are some more facts; as the Dude would say, “new shit has come to light.” Or rather, thanks to Inter-Library Loan, I received some new information that I’ve not seen cited in the standard accounts.\nMorison says the British plane, an RAF Hudson, “dropped his depth charges more or less at random.” I did know that Greer was broadcasting the U-boat’s position, so that it wouldn’t have been all that random, but I hadn’t picked up on that in the account.\nBut there is also the question, often raised, of whether the U-boat commander saw the Greer; you usually read that we don’t know what he observed, or historians will impute behavior to him, as I quoted Waldo Heinrichs doing, saying the U-boat captain “must have regarded as hostile pursuit” the Greer’s continued following of the U-boat. Or consider Kenneth S. Davis’s account: “the harassed U-boat, its desperate commander probably believing the destroyer had made the depth-charge attack actually made by the British plane, suddenly fired a torpedo at the destroyer, then a second one, perhaps a third.”1\nIt did occur to me that someone might have sometime looked into the German records, and (again, thanks to ILL) I can now say the U-boat captain’s state of mind was not so clear as all that. Nor was the firing of the torpedo sudden.\nThe U-boat, U 652, under the command of Lieutenant Georg-Werner Fraatz, had been running on the surface, and then “dived after sighting an aircraft” (und hatte dann nach Sichten eines Flugzeuges getaucht,) according to Gerard E. Hasselwander, who was working with the war diaries (Kriegstachebücher) of U 652. So Fraatz, the U-boat captain, did know he was being pursued by an aircraft—although Hasselwander says that when the depth charges exploded, the crew believed they had come from the destroyer they could hear overhead (glaubte seine Besatzung, daß der Zerstörer, den sie über sich hören konnten, der Angreifer sei).2\nAfter the two hours’ pursuit without further attack, Fraatz was somewhat confused; he could not understand what he called the destroyer’s “hesitant behavior.” (Der U-Bootkommandant konnte jedoch das „zögernde Verhalten” des Zerstörers nicht verstehen.) So he came to periscope depth and had a look at it. He might even have surfaced, Hasselwander says, had not the weather been so good and the high visibility thus a risk to him—he could see, now, another plane above the Greer. At this point, he fired two torpedoes at the destroyer.\nHasselwander says we don’t really know why those two hours passed before Fraatz fired on the destroyer. Maybe he didn’t have a clean shot. But maybe also he had “concerns” (Bedenken)—about what, Hasselwander doesn’t say; but one possible concern would be that the destroyer was certainly not acting like a British destroyer, which meant that it might belong to a neutral power, possibly the United States.3 Given what we know about the division in German thinking about a naval war against the United States at this time, we might suppose that this same division was reflected in Fraatz’s mind."

    "section": "",
    "text": "How much of a threat did Germany pose to the United States before Pearl Harbor? That’s the big question; let’s look at a small part of it. Historians often say Roosevelt exaggerated the specific threats Nazi Germany posed; here we’ll look at one claim about the threat posed by German bombers.\nIt might seem to us remarkable that in December 1940, airplanes could fly the distance of an Atlantic round trip, but it was not remarkable to claim it. The crossing comes to about a 3,000-mile flight one way, so a return journey would total 6,000 miles. The Imperial Airways seaplane Mercury completed a flight of more than 6,000 miles non-stop from Dundee, Scotland to the Orange River in South Africa in October 1938.2 This feat was reported in the newspapers, together with comparable records. Not only was Roosevelt’s statement simply true, many of his listeners would have known it already.\nLet’s look more closely at Roosevelt’s specific claim. This is what it says in the reading copy:\nAnd here’s what Roosevelt actually said, according to transcription at the time:\nFirst, this claim was refined in the process of writing the speech. Thanks to the FDR Presidential Library, we can link to the relevant folder in the Master Speech File and see that in earlier drafts, this paragraph read,\nThe claim that planes could fly return from New York to London was probably supportable enough, given the flight of the Mercury. But at the seventh draft, Roosevelt changed it (notice the handwriting):\nNow not only is the distance more accurate and defensible—from “the British Isles” to “New England” is more accurately the route Imperial Airways was even then, despite the war, flying; but by changing its direction Roosevelt was, of course, emphasizing the potential threat should Britain fall to Germany.\nSecond, the claim about the outside range of existing aircraft is coupled here with a second claim. It’s clear with these two sentences that Roosevelt and his speechwriters are making a distinction between what the longest-distance airplanes could already do, and what modern bombers could soon do. This observation supports a generalization I want to make and will probably make again: Roosevelt and his speechwriters were quite careful.\nThe claim about how bombers were then developing, and what their capacity would be, was also correct. The B-29, though it was still on the drawing board, would have a maximum range of 5,830 miles. The experimental predecessor to the B-29, the XB-15, had already flown in 1937, and derived from a plan for a bomber with an effective range of 5,000 miles.3 Americans attentive to the news would have known about the XB-15; Major Caleb Haynes of the US Army air corps had flown one on an earthquake relief mission from Langley to Santiago, Chile, stopping in Panama and Peru, in February 1939.\nAgain, not only did Roosevelt make a carefully constructed and factually correct claim, he made one that many of his listeners would have understood to be readily supportable."

    "text": "This is not a review of Masters of the Air; I’m not a tv critic and in the end I mainly enjoyed it for what it was—this is instead a discussion of what it’s not: a story of the US bomber war in Europe, which I think could still be dramatized someday.\nThe basic, traditional history of the US bomber war in Europe has a clear dramatic arc. It starts with high hopes; these are swiftly tempered by cruel realities; in the end much is gained though much also is lost, and at the close of it, one would be hard-pressed to say that the right lessons are learned or that the just will prosper while the unjust receive their comeuppance. That’s a narrative with which a talented dramatist could keep an audience, I think.\nWe could put a few concrete details on that narrative line:\nIt began with the idea of precision strikes at the means of making war by bombers capable of self-defense tasked with achieving, to pick a phrase, “victory through air power.”\nThat idea is what sent US air crews and factory-fresh B-24s to the North African desert in 1942, with the intention of striking at the vitals of the German war machine—the oil refineries in Romania. This little raid inspired the local Luftwaffe colonel to observe, “This is the beginning.” The Germans, recognizing what would come next, prepared. Subsequent raids on the oil refineries by North Africa-based B-24s incurred heavy US losses—some 280 aircraft and some 2,800 airmen.\nThat pattern, of striking at industrial targets with the idea of crushing the factories that made modern war possible, and finding out that German defenses could destroy more bombers than the Americans could afford to lose, persisted. Moreover, precision bombing—as the RAF already knew—was a fantasy. The much-celebrated Norden bombsight could, maybe, deliver precision over the sunny US southwest, where many pilots trained—bombs into pickle barrels from thousands of feet in the air!—but it was a very different thing over cloudy and fighter-infested northern and central Europe.\nThe bombing campaign in 1942–43 (I am reasonably persuaded by modern historians like Phillips O’Brien) may have achieved more than conventional wisdom allows.1 But those gains came at unsustainable costs: the US couldn’t afford to lose so many trained pilots and crews.\nIt wasn’t until the advances of fighter technology (increased range for P-47s and the arrival of P-51s) as well as advances of the Allies into Western Europe that allowed a free range of bombing in Germany and German-held territory. And the campaigns of early 1944 helped pave the way for D-Day.\nIn the end the bombing campaign became more what the RAF leaders, particularly Arthur Harris, always insisted it had to be: a parallel to and would-be replacement for the ground war, an attempt to pummel the Germans into surrender. The destruction of Dresden in February 1945 stuck out in the minds even of some airmen at the time as exceptionally brutal—though that feeling was swiftly muddied by news out of the liberated concentration camps, and a renewed feeling (for some people, anyway) that the savagery had to be stopped, even if by savage means.\nWhatever the justice of that sentiment, its essence (“we did terrible things that had to be done”) was a long way from the (literally) Disneyfied original vision of the bomber war.\nAnyway: that’s the narrative of the US bomber war which I kind of wanted to see dramatized. It’s not exactly not in Masters of the Air, but nor is it foregrounded; the series is really the story of a few guys who were among the last out of Stalag Luft III and, for the sake of perspective, a couple of their luckier squadron members. Which is fine, that’s a real story. And you get to see some B-17s and P-51s, and some of the misery and horror of aerial combat.\nBut though some of those narrative beats I outlined above do appear in the series, they do so only fleetingly. Indeed, owing to the focus on the pilots who were shot down, the air war itself largely vanishes from the narrative. I wanted to see some discussion of Hamburg, Caen, Dresden, the bombing of the IG Farben site at Auschwitz-Birkenau; they’re not here.\nAs I say, this is not a review of Masters of the Air, because it would be annoying if it were. But I did want to sketch quickly a story of the bomber war that could be dramatized.\nAnd because I just have to, here’s a chart that shows why I’d like to see some airplanes that aren’t B-17s or P-51s."

    "text": "So far as I can tell the best source of data on the number and direction of German Jews fleeing the Nazi regime remains Werner Rosenstock’s 1956 article, “Exodus, 1933–1939,” which has been reprinted a number of times including in the Nazi Holocaust collection and still sees citation in books on the subject.1 Rosenstock himself noted that his figures were estimates only, and partial at that, though he did his best to check them against other source and ensure they provided at least an approximately accurate picture of trends and volumes. To make the graph at right I’ve had to do a little arithmetic to draw numbers out of Rosenstock’s article; he preferred to report propotions, probably to avoid a spurious precision—I say all that by way of trying to avoid a charge of making it appear more sure than it is.\nEven so, I think it’s useful to attempt a graphical representation of the trends, because it allows us to see a few things that Rosenstock indicates in his article. First, that those who left Nazi Germany preferred hopefully to believe that they would not have to go far; that the madness would burn itself out and they could return home. So you see that other European countries were the initial first choice of those who fled Hitler’s regime.\nSecond, you can see that Palestine was the next-most popular choice—though it peaked in popularity early, in 1934, and in 1936, refugees were more likely to head for overseas destinations than for Palestine, perhaps because of the Arab uprising that began that year and which included attacks on Jewish settlements.\nAnd last, you can see the increasing importance of the United States as a destination for Jewish refugees. (Note by the way that all the figures for 1938 include only half the year.) Although Rosenstock doesn’t disaggregate figures to overseas destinations for 1935 and 1936, one can suppose that the United States took a large amount of the refugees heading across oceans in those years as well.\nFurther, as Rosenstock notes, many of the refugees who first headed to European countries later sought destinations elsewhere.\nEventually, by 1938, the global disposition of the approximately 107,000 German Jewish refugees who found their way overseas looked something like the below, according to what Rosenstock describes as “semi-official” figures.3"

    "text": "In February 1935 the Supreme Court was about to issue an opinion on the question of whether the Roosevelt administration’s policy of taking the country off the gold standard was constitutional.\nOn first coming into office Roosevelt ended the gold standard—people could no longer exchange a dollar for the statutory rate of $20.67 to an ounce of pure gold. By this measure Roosevelt meant to induce the expectation of inflation, and start money out of hoarding and into circulation. Over the course of 1933 the administration devalued the dollar by various means and early in 1934, using the authority of the new Gold Reserve Act, set the dollar at $35 to an ounce of gold, subject to change.\nThe administration viewed its policy of moving away from the gold standard and toward a managed dollar as an effective means of fighting the Depression and also of rallying other countries to recovery. Indeed, it proved effective, both economically and eventually as a tool to assemble an international coalition against fascism.1 To reverse this policy in 1935 and return to the lower prices of 1932 would be calamitous economically, politically, and diplomatically.\nRoosevelt and his advisors considered various options for getting around an adverse Court opinion; one idea the president floated was to have Federal Reserve branches honor the commitment to redeem paper money in gold at the teller window, but to forbid depositors from taking that gold out of the building, requiring them instead to exchange it for paper money if they wished to return it to circulation.\nRoosevelt also prepared an address to give in the event of the Court demanding he reverse course. In it, he prepared to illustrate in concrete terms how dangerous such a policy would be, and to conclude,\nHe promised further messages and actions to that end in the coming days.\nHe never had to give the speech; the Court left this policy—unlike many others—intact. But he meant to fight the Court if he had to."

    "text": "Together with my colleague, and sometimes solo, I’ve been teaching our department’s course on the history of World War II for something like a dozen years. Students have always come to it with certain expectations, and while these vary over the years—and with the release of Hollywood movies set in the war—one kind of question crops up pretty much every time: “why didn’t the Allies [or Axis] just do X?” And usually X is something that occurred to the Allies, or Axis, to do—it was just that they did not have the resources to do X and also the other things they considered priorities. That is, for most of the war the question of allocating finite, often severely limited, resources that strategists believed better allocated elsewhere.\nAn illustration: early in 1941, Roosevelt was prepared to send the carrier Yorktown together with a group of battleships from the Pacific to the Atlantic to augment the existing fleet, and protect Lend-Lease shipping to Britain against U-boat attack. The Navy drew up plans for this proposal.\nBut then, in April, the Soviets and the Japanese agreed to a neutrality pact. Such a pact would assure the Soviets could focus on Europe and the Japanese on the Pacific, without having to worry about fighting each other. Because Japan now had a freer hand in the Pacific, the president changed his mind and sent only Yorktown to the Atlantic.\n\n\n\nYorktown at the dock in Norfolk, Virginia, 1941. Naval History and Heritage Command.\n\n\nSo this is the first limitation we need to remember: a limited quantity of resources, in this case ships of war. To move ships to the Atlantic to fight U-boats meant those ships wouldn’t be available in the Pacific to fend off an attack by Japan.\nThe second one is time. Yorktown departed Pearl Harbor on April 22, 1941, and arrived in Bermuda on May 12, 1941. It took three weeks to move from one posting to another.\nThis is the second limitation; that of time. To move resources from one theater to another is not instantaneous and thus not easy to reverse.\nRoosevelt’s decision—or indecision, as it may be—was shaped by these limits: not enough ships to have adequate force everywhere, and a constraint of time such that allocation of resources was not easily reversed.\nAnd limits like those shaped most decision-makers for most of the war. Roosevelt would have liked to leave enough ships on station in the Pacific while also devoting increased force to the Atlantic, but he couldn’t."

    "text": "Much as I crankily complain about e-texts (tldr; for scholarly use and for instruction they are not as accessible as they should be), we live in an age of wonderful online documents, including the US Treasury Bulletin, of which one may find the December 1940 number here. And in that number one may find the Treasury’s own breakdown of the New Deal budgets, which I depict here in graphical format.\n\n\n\nUS budgets, 1933–1940 by Treasury categories, dividing “ordinary” from “New Deal” expenditures.\n\n\nDuring the 1932 campaign, Franklin Roosevelt tried (as candidates often do) to have his cake and eat it too—that is, to promise both that he would be more frugal than Herbert Hoover and that he would spend extraordinary sums on unemployment relief as part of his New Deal. Roosevelt gave a respectable cast to this pledge to have it both ways by distinguishing between the “ordinary” expenditures of the federal government, which he would cut, and the necessary emergency expenditures of the New Deal, which would grow as large as they must to provide relief. As he said in his speech on the budget in Pittsburgh, (transcript here) under Hoover “our Federal Government has experienced unprecedented deficits,” which needed paying for in taxation, “a brake on any return to normal business activity.” He proposed therefore to cut the expenditures of the federal government—while excepting the emergency expenditures necessary for the New Deal:\n\nwhat I am talking about more especially tonight are the taxes which go to the ordinary costs of conducting government year in and year out—and that is where the question of extravagance comes in. There can be no extravagance when starvation is in question; but extravagance does apply to the mounting budget of the Federal Government in Washington during these past four years.\n\nRoosevelt kept budget-cutting a priority, while also preserving this exception, once inaugurated. The first major New Deal measure after the banking and currency legislation was the Economy Act, which gave the president extraordinary powers to cut the budget. On March 24, 1933, just after the passage of the Economy Act, a reporter asked Roosevelt if he would balance the budget, and the president gave an answer that hewed to the distinction, however inventive, he had made during the campaign.\n\n\n\nPress conference remarks distinguishing ordinary from emergency spending. FDRL\n\n\nAs you can see from the chart, Roosevelt (through his budget-cutting deputy Lewis Douglas) used the Economy Act’s authority to reduce what he considered “ordinary” federal spending in his first budget, and the “ordinary” expenses of the government remained down through his first term. Of course, he more than made up for that drop with New Deal spending."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ultimately, what troubles me most about standard accounts of the Greer incident is the tendency to treat evidence showing the U-boat captain didn’t know the destroyer was a US ship as a gotcha for the Roosevelt administration. Roosevelt’s speech on the incident, and the policy he announced as a result, didn’t depend on the U-boat captain knowing Greer was a US ship; in fact, Roosevelt quite expressly said otherwise.\nA transcript of the president’s remarks as delivered appear in the Master Speech File at the Roosevelt Library in the second folder on this address; big pdf link here.\nHere’s what seems to me the most important passage, so far as the Greer incident itself goes:\nRoosevelt does say before this passage that it was broad daylight and the destroyer was flying the American flag. Moreover he imputes to the U-boat commander the “deliberate design to sink her.”\nBut the key, so far as his argument goes, seems to me here: if the German U-boat saw Greer was a US ship and fired at her, that’s an act of war—but! if it didn’t see Greer and ascertain her identity, that’s “even more outrageous”; it’s “indiscriminate violence,” and even worse.\nThus Roosevelt’s argument does not hinge on the Germans’ knowing they were firing on a US ship. You’d never know it the way many historians talk about it. For example:\nBut Roosevelt’s speech didn’t, as I say, depend on Greer’s identity as a US ship. Much to the contrary; he says it’s actually worse if the U-boat didn’t know it. (Moreover, as previously noted, the Nazis absolutely did mean to abolish freedom of the seas as prelude to war with the United States.)\nFurther: Roosevelt then goes on in the speech to outline a pattern. The Germans had previously sunk the US merchantman Robin Moor, the Panamanian ship Sessa, and the US merchant vessel Steel Seafarer. You could reasonably suppose the Germans didn’t particularly care whose ships they were sinking.\nIndeed, historians now know—or should know, at any rate—that’s precisely the case, both in the specific case of the Greer and in general. In the National Archives, one may find a decrypted message from Lt. Fraatz, of U 652, to the German commander of submarines, dated September 5, 1941, explaining he had fired torpedoes at “DESTROYER, FLING [sic] UNKNOWN FLAG.”2 Fraatz knew Greer wasn’t acting like a British ship. He didn’t think it was a British ship. He was puzzled by its behavior, and he didn’t know whose ship it was. But he fired on it anyway. Which is what Roosevelt described as “even more outrageous” than knowing it was a US ship.\nPerhaps Fraatz, via the various communications channels of Raeder’s navy, absorbed the message given by Hitler earlier in the summer. On July 25, 1941, one of the many occasions when Hitler urged patience, awaiting the right moment to attack the United States, he said,\nAs I say, Fraatz’s specific behavior reflects this general carelessness. The Greer might have been an American ship; it might not. But there was no harm in shooting at it if it were. That’s precisely the view that Roosevelt objected to, describing it as “piracy.”"

Arad was able to discover records of 480 or so such trains and, knowing that “the Germans pushed 100 to 150 people into each freight car,” arrive at an estimate of their burden.2\nAuschwitz presents a trickier problem because it was not solely a death camp. Deportees arriving in the camp went through a selection process from which some were registered and sent to labor; the unregistered were sent to their death. One must therefore look at the number of deportees and the number registered and in most cases, as Robert Jan van Pelt writes, “All the deportees were either killed on arrival, and therefore not registered; or admitted to the camp and registered.”3 He cites the work of Franciszek Piper, who in the 1980s began working from previously compiled documentation and estimates to arrive at reliable figures.4\nIn 2019, Lewi Stone put together a data series including Arad’s and Piper’s figures, together with some more representing Jews killed by the Einsatzgrüppen during the invasion of the Soviet Union (the “Shoah by bullet”) to come up with a time series showing the number of Jews murdered in the death camps as against Auschwitz and by shooting. Stone’s concern is the intensity of this genocide as against others, but for the purpose of teaching World War II, it’s more useful for showing the timing of the Holocaust and its relation to the other events of the war. Stone’s article doesn’t have his raw data, but a piece he wrote for The Conversation does.5 From it one can make a chart such as the below."

    "text": "Below are my comments, as prepared, from the Washington History Seminar session of October 16, 2023, if you’d like to read them. If you’d like to see the whole session as it actrually transpired, video is at this link. Thanks to Eric Arnesen, Christian Ostermann, and Rachel Wheatley for organizing the session on behalf of the American Historical Association and the Woodrow Wilson Center’s History and Public Policy Program.\nI want first of all to congratulate Brooke on this book, which is as readable a work of history, and as fascinating a narrative, as I have come across in a long time.1 I can assure you it will fill a spot on a number of my holiday gift lists this year, and I imagine it will do the same for many people listening; it is a handsome book and will, I suspect, be a welcome gift for the readers you know, so make a note wherever you make your notes about what to get people for the holidays.\nIt’s a beautifully conceived book: that is, it’s one thing to think of writing a book around the uncertain time in 1943 when it was not yet clear that the Allies would win the war, but it’s a stroke of genuine inspiration to ground that book in this particular, dramatic event—the crash of Pan Am’s Yankee Clipper—and to use the lives of the people on board to develop all the ways that uncertainty and that war manifested themselves in individual lives.\nPerhaps still more extraordinary, it’s a good idea that is exceptionally well executed. You’ve pursued, methodically and carefully, a wide range of sources, familiarizing yourself with the histories of politics, business, law, theater, aviation, shipping, and much more. In so doing, you’ve demonstrated an active and empathetic historical imagination, an ability to envision and then to encompass the strange old world of a vanished past.\nSo the book is not only beautifully conceived, but carefully constructed, which is a rare combination indeed.\nFor the purposes of sparking further discussion, I’d like to highlight two points.\nFirst, the book really does show you, as the title says it will, a variety of Americans experiencing the world at war—not just from 1939 or 1931, or whenever you date the beginning of the Second World War, but really from 1914 onward, as your section titles indicate. And so—one of the things I really like about his book is that it’s narrative, rather than argumentative; you show, rather than tell—but for the purposes of our discussion here it might be appropriate for you to show your hand a bit more—so it seems to me you’re taking the position, taken by Winston Churchill and many others before you, that this is essentially the twentieth century’s Thirty Years War, a continuous event from 1914 through to 1945, and properly embraced as such.2\nNow, as I say that’s not an uncommon position to take, but it’s one that might have interpretive implications that, in a book like this, run under the surface, but I wonder if you could draw them out. How does it change your understanding of the Second World War to say that it’s really of a piece with the First?\nSo that’s my first question.\nOkay, now for a second point. I’ve been very complimentary to this point, so I hope you won’t mind the least critical remark possible: I don’t think you needed to be even a tiny bit defensive, as I did think you were in the closing “note on method,” about writing a book about the Second World War. I think this is a subject that falls squarely into the category of “things that are endlessly popular because they are, in fact, endlessly interesting.” You would have had to apologize, perhaps, if you’d written a book that simply trundled over known territory and known evidence—which of course many people do. Which is why, for example, when Max Hastings wrote his one-volume survey in 2011 he set himself the challenge of using “relatively obscure anecdotage at the expense of justly celebrated personal recollections,” as he put it.3\nNow, the structure of your book leads you to all kinds of areas and byways which do this naturally, that is, you follow the people’s stories where they go—so we hear about the fascinatingly gray area of trade with neutral, but Axis-aligned, Spain, which we don’t often get to; we hear about some of the actual mechanics of Lend-Lease, which was a wonderful, world-wide system, a genuine logistical achievement, which is usually just sort of waved at. When you talk about some of Frank’s broadcasts, you talk about the challenge he faced in trying to “make real” the complex web of connections in the Pacific world, this legacy of empire transformed by the exigencies of war. You get a lot of wonderful anecdotage of your own because of it. I was especially taken with the sad side effect of the Nazi-Soviet Pact on Tamara’s production—that is, “Dancing Stalin would have to be cut.” What a wonderful line.\nI’m curious, though: in writing a book about people to whom, for the most part, the war is happening—they are Americans In a World At War, not “waging a world war,” or something like that—which I think correctly describes the felt experience of most Americans, that this war happened to them. And that effect is I think amplified by your choice of date; after all, this crash happens, and the book ends, just at the point when the United States really began to take much more of a leading role in the war.\nSo that’s my second question: what do you think it does for our understanding of the Second World War, to narrate it more as an event that happened to Americans, rather than one in which they were in the drivers’ seat?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "On November 12, 1940, shortly after Roosevelt’s re-election to a unique third term in the presidency, Chief of Naval Operations Harold Stark sent a memorandum to the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, outlining the US military position. The document became known as “Plan Dog,” after the US-UK phonetic alphabet for “D” (Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, etc.) because out of the options Stark considered, he recommended proceeding with the one he lettered “D”—a joint offensive with Britain against Germany in the Atlantic, in anticipation of a wider war.\nThe memorandum runs 26 pages and covers a lot of ground. Here is a single paragraph, from page 19, where Stark gives a succinct summary of his argument for US concern about the German threat.\nThe security of the US depends on the security of the Americas; the security of the Americas depends on a balance of power in Europe; German defeat of Britain will end that balance and its destruction or acquisition of the British fleet would enable a German attack on the Americas and thus imperil the United States.\nWe know Hitler thought in similar, if reversed, terms, planning a war on the United States once he had secured his European triumph, though he did not necessarily feel he needed to defeat Britain—merely the Soviet Union, which he expected to do swiftly.\nStark thus believed the first question was how best to preserve Britain from defeat. He rejected focusing on likely war with Japan, or strictly defensive options, and advocated his option D: a joint offensive with Britain in the Atlantic, while keeping a strong defensive posture in the Pacific. The US fleet should remain in the Pacific until war was “imminent.” Assistance to Britain would mean protecting shipping in the western Atlantic, and reinforcing British naval operations around the British Isles and down the coast of Africa, as well as in the Mediterranean.\nThe chief of naval operations further acknowledged that “purely naval assistance, would not, in my opinion, assure final victory for Great Britain,” and moreover that Britain lacked the manpower to win an infantry campaign on its own. “I believe that the United States, in addition to sending naval assistance, would also need to send large air and land forces to Europe or Africa, or both, and to participate strongly in this land offensive.”\nAny other option, Stark believed, would end in British collapse—and thus a serious threat to US security.\nThe memorandum thus recommended joint Army-Navy plans and moreover, “secret staff talks on technical matters with the British military and naval authorities” to assure coordination of the impending war effort.\nThe Army accepted Stark’s memo with the addition that the United States should expect to supply substantial air support in a war alongside the British. The president authorized the staff conversations, and on December 2, 1940, Stark invited the British to come to Washington for joint planning.1"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Awhile ago I set up a feed called “What’s History” on Bluesky, the as-yet invite-only microblogging social media service that is a bit livelier than some and freer of unpleasantly trollish features than others.\nFeeds are a Bluesky feature; essentially they allow you to curate your own algorithm. This one is simple: if you’re on a set list of approved posters, and you post using the card file box emoji 🗃, that post will show up in the feed. If you go to the feed at the link above, and “like” it, it will appear among your feeds; if you pin it, you can set it so it appears on your Bluesky homepage, like this. UPDATED TO ADD that I’ve amended the feed to include any post that uses the word “skystorians” to accommodate people who don’t care for emoji. So you can use either the card file box or skystorians to send a skeet to the feed.\n\n\n\nBluesky homepage, with “What’s History” next to Following and Mutuals feeds.\n\n\nAs you can see there, a user on the approved list can quote-skeet something that did not have the card file box emoji with the emoji, and have it stuck in the feed.\nFAQ\n\nWhy “What’s History?” The original Bluesky feed was called “What’s Hot,” and any post with a given number of likes (I think it was twelve?) would appear on the feed. Soon after, someone set up “What’s Science,” with an approved poster list and an emoji, so I followed suit with “What’s History.”\nWhy an emoji instead of a hashtag? One character toward your total, instead of several.\nWhy that emoji? I wanted something that looked like something relating to historical practice that wasn’t field specific and which people were very unlikely to post incidentally. The card file box, familiar to historians of more advanced ages (like me) as a place to store your notes and bibliography, seemed to fit the bill.\nWhy is the list of approved posters a “mute list”? That list, here, is as it says not for muting but to provide the basis for the feed. At the time of creating the list, a mute list was the only kind of list Bluesky recognized.\nHow can I set up my own feed? Paul Musgrave has a good guide here.\nHow can I get on the list? Just @ me on Bluesky.\nHow can I get on Bluesky? Someone on Bluesky can invite you.\nDo I want to be on Bluesky? Man, I don’t know, but I think a lot of historians missed the community provided by certain other sites, and an increasing number have shown up on Bluesky. There are a few journalists who are worth your time. Maybe someday soon there will be a substantial number of editors and publishers, too, and then it will begin to be a more useful professional network. More seem to be appearing all the time.\nADDED: WHY DIDN’T IT WORK? Every now and then I get this one, and, well, ¯\\_ (ツ)_/¯. If you’re on the list (again, here) and you used the emoji, it should work! All I can plead is that it’s a beta site, I guess; sorry. I have noticed it does take a little time, sometime, especially on busy days. It is possible that it’s something to do with spacing around the emoji, i.e., that you need to have a space before and/or after, but I’m not sure."

    "text": "The US strategy for building up an Atlantic squadron depended on reactivating ships from the first world war, mothballed during the optimistic years of the 1920s. Roosevelt ordered their swifter return to duty at around the time of the Munich agreement, when he established the Atlantic Squadron—first as a smaller unit including only new cruisers, but soon attaching to it what had been the Training Squadron of older battleships and destroyers stationed on the East Coast.\nIt took much longer than expected or hoped to revive the old ships, which had been laid firmly away and often with little or no record as to their peculiarities. It turned out to be fortunate that they returned to duty while the nation was still at peace and German ships were generally far away; their crews had to get their vessels in shape by sailing them to and beyond their limits, to discover what needed alteration and repair.1"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Admiral Stark’s “Plan Dog” memo sets as a basic aim the “preservation of the territorial, economic, and ideological integrity of the United States plus that of the remainder of the Western hemisphere.” Which for me raises a question Stark doesn’t address: what does he mean by “ideological integrity”? That question is difficult enough when applied to the United States; it’s even more knotty when applied to the rest of the Western Hemisphere. We can take up the question of the Good Neighbor Policy later; let’s look specifically at the United States. A couple months after the Plan Dog memo, Roosevelt would speak to Congress and outline the “four freedoms,” an ideological basis for US involvement in the war: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear—everywhere in the world. I’ll talk more about that speech later, too; for this post I want to talk about the earliest public mention I know of those four basic rights, in a discussion between the Roosevelts and members of the American Youth Congress on June 5, 1940.\n\n\n\nWilliam Hinckley of the American Youth Congress addresses the Dies (House UnAmerican Activities) Committee, November 30, 1939. Library of Congress.\n\n\nThe American Youth Congress (AYC) included a variety of organizations, among them the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, but it was widely supposed to have fallen under the influence of communists. It was also a favorite cause of Eleanor Roosevelt, who liked the idea of being in touch with the young people of the nation, which is why members of the AYC were in the state dining room of the White House on June 5, to talk to the president—and to prod him from his political left. One delegate after another asked him about the nation’s, and the administration’s, lackluster record on voting rights for Black citizens. They pressed him on the poll tax. They asked him whether the Allies were not in fact colonialist powers with at best a selective implementation of democracy. Roosevelt gave an honestly relativist answer, saying that whatever the Allies were fighting for, it was “a better form of democracy, certainly, than Germany is fighting for.”\nAfter a while, one questioner gave him an opening to try something different. How, the president was asked, would he ensure that an Allied victory would produce a better outcome than it had in 1918?\n\nLet’s take this assumption that the world, the people of the world entrusted you to write the next peace. . . . How would America be effective in establishing democratic governments if that is the clue to future peace?\n\nFor this question, Roosevelt sounded prepared.\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of what we would seek. That is something. In other words, we have a program that is no secret. It is the elimination—I have put it that way on several occasions—it is the elimination of four fears.\n\nHe went on to explain these “four fears” as the worry people had that they might not be able to exercise their essential freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of expression—and “the fear of arms” as well as, “the fear of not being able to have normal economic and social relations with other nations. . . . freedom of commerce and freedom of culture, because the two go hand in hand.”\nPressed on this amorphous last point—“Doesn’t it seem there should be a fifth item, that of giving people economic security in all countries?”—Roosevelt said, “Yes, that is the fourth point I am making.”\nAfter the president left the room, the First Lady and Harry Hopkins answered more questions. In the course of this continued discussion, Eleanor Roosevelt said of the president’s positions on aid to the Allies,\n\nA year and a half, two years ago, he said every single thing on defense that he said aloud today to individual members of Congress and gave the very same reasons. . . . Today, they are all running to him because the circumstances, the life of the world, have hit them in the face. . . . But they were not ready two years ago.\n\nThe president’s statement that he had used the “four fears” formulation “on several occasions,” together with Eleanor’s saying that he had been using these reasons for somewhere between eighteen months and two years, suggest—as did the president’s saying that his views were “no secret”—that he had somehow, to someone or several someones, mentioned ensuring these basic rights as the essential basis for US aid to the Allies. But as I say, this is the first public occasion of which I’m aware. And even here, as you can see, the formulation is not complete; the “freedom from want” was anything but clearly framed.\nWhat you can also see is that Roosevelt, whether using this argument with “individual members of Congress” or young, evidently leftist Americans, was trying to provide an ideological answer to why the US should aid the Allies: to fight for a world in which essential human rights were globally guaranteed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s a pivotal moment in Ford v. Ferrari when Henry Ford II explains why the American automaker is going to defeat the Italian one.\nIt’s a great scene as played (by Tracy Letts and Matt Damon) and it’s a great scene as written, by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller.\nI’d be lying if I claimed I didn’t enjoy it, or the rest of the movie. But it is, of course, total nonsense in any number of ways.\nThe germ of truth there is that Ford did build a lot of B-24 Liberator bombers at the Willow Run plant it operated in Ypsilanti, Michigan. David M. Kennedy says about half the 18,000 or so Liberators built during the war came from Willow Run, and that at peak efficiency, the plant turned out one every sixty-three minutes.1\nSo Willow Run was run by Ford and it did build a lot of bombers that were vital to the Eighth Air Force’s bombing campaign in Europe. Especially before D-Day, the long-range B-24 presented the best hope of striking deep into the heart of the continent. (Although if you know anything about the Ploesti raid, you know that hope was far too costly to realize until long-range fighters were generally available.)\nBut of course, (A) about half the B-24s is nowhere near three-fifths of the bombers and (B) the bombing campaign didn’t defeat Hitler, though it certainly made a difference.\nMaybe most important, Ford didn’t build the plant. Let’s look at the relevant page in the report on War Industrial Facilities Authorized July 1940–August 1945.2\nMaybe the writing there is a bit small. It says, “Willow Run Airplane Factory, Ypsilanti Mich, New Plant; Heavy Bombers, B-24, Additional sub-assemblies.” Then it says, “Total cost, $94,898”—that’s in thousands of dollars, so about $95 million. Then it says that of the total cost of $94,898,000, the public funds contributed were $94,898,000. In other words, all of it. As you can see, under “Privately financed,” there is the entry “–”.\nMark Wilson did his best to make this point in Destructive Creation, but I guess the Ford v. Ferrari writers didn’t read it. Wilson notes that not only did the federal government foot the bill for this, as it did for much wartime construction, it actively ran the programs, setting costs, specification, laboring conditions, and lots more. To use the case of the B-24 as a continuing example, the bomber was originally developed by Consolidated Aircraft of San Diego, and Roosevelt administration officials grew dissatisfied with its progress in 1941. One wrote that “I have never seen so large an outfit run as ‘haphazardly’ as this one.”3 So, as Wilson notes, the administration edged out Consolidated’s CEO, facilitated the firm’s takeover by Vultee and the installation of Tom Girdler (formerly of Republic Steel) to run it.4 Girdler, Time alleged, had by then “made his peace with Franklin Roosevelt and the C.I.O.”\nSo no, it wouldn’t be right to say that “Roosevelt beat Hitler,” of course. But it’s not right to say that Willow Run was exactly Henry Ford’s doing, either."

    "text": "I was looking through a drawer and came across a Bob Dylan-adjacent thing I’d written and forgotten, because my cv has only the academic stuff on it. Given the Discourse around A Complete Unknown, I thought I’d share.\nConor McPherson (who wrote The Weir) wrote and directed Girl From the North Country, a play featuring the songs of Bob Dylan. Set in a boarding-house in Duluth, Minnesota in 1934, it wove Dylan’s songs (performed on Depression-era instruments) through a story about that hard time.\nGirl From the North Country was opening at the Old Vic in the summer of 2017; the director of the company producing the program(me) wrote to ask me if I’d contribute an essay on the state of the country, and Minnesota, at that time. So of course I said yes. They sent me the script, I wrote the essay based on the themes I saw in the play, and it went into the programme under the title “A Most Dangerous Time.” When the production moved to the Noël Coward Theatre in the West End a few months later, they kindly kept the essay in the new programme. The text of it appears below the pictures.\nThe end of 1934 brought a most dangerous time to America. The four Depression winters following the 1929 crash came on hard. Each one worse than the one before, with more out of work, more going hungry, more on the roads, more families broken up and people broken down. Despair stole over the nation’s soul.\nBut then in 1933 a slender hope seized the citizens who could see that just ever so slightly, things might start getting better. With a new president and a New Deal came new jobs, and a hard, long road along which Americans were nevertheless heading in the right direction, toward work and dignity and an end to the waking nightmare of grinding want. The president, Franklin Roosevelt, knew how terrible a thing this little hope could be. Before, in the forlorn depths of the Depression, Americans had known chiefly how to suffer. But now, with a little hope in them, they sensed their improved prospects, and felt a new restlessness. And it was, Roosevelt worried, ‘disappointed hope, rather than despair, [that] creates revolutions,’ and with this fragile and unrealised hope in them the people stirred that winter on the brink of action, not knowing which way they might lurch.\nMinnesotans felt it, the risk that came with a little hope in 1934. They spent the summer enthralled by an industrial civil war that was called out on the state’s radio stations as if it were a football game pitting communists against capitalists.\nThe fertile prairie state, rich in grain and home to the headwaters of the Mississippi, had become in the industrial age the trucking hub of the American north-west, where the produce of the heartland could be processed, packed and shipped out again. In the years of the Depression, with scarcely any work to be had, the prices people could pay had fallen so low that it was hardly worth a farmer’s while to harvest the crops in the fields, for the pittance they would fetch if brought to market. Wheat went to seed and corn rotted on the stalk.\nBut in 1934, with business picking up, the flow of goods into the state’s cities resumed, and on this tide of renewed commerce came an opportunity for workers to claim a portion of prosperity. They formed unions, asking for better wages. There were actual communists among the labour leaders, a fact to which the state’s businessmen pointed in rage but, under the circumstances, to little effect. Minnesota boasted a unique achievement: a daily union newspaper, The Organizer, that turned a profit, and it editorialised in a workingman’s voice that ‘these here bosses we got in town keep yellin’ in the papers that communism and payin’ 54½ cents an hour is one an’ the same thing. Well, if that’s what it is I guess I’m a communist an’ I expect most every one in the world . . . must be too.’\nThe union went on strike, shutting trucking down in Minneapolis for more than a month in the summer heat. Strikers and policemen fought in the streets. In one clash, the policemen ambushed strikers, shooting them in the back as they turned to run, killing a few and sending dozens to the hospital. The governor, Floyd Olson, a member of the Farmer-Labor Party, had to declare martial law and personally prevailed on President Roosevelt to intervene—which he did, assigning a mediator to force a resolution recognising the union, setting minimum wages and maximum hours. The governor and the president believed they had averted revolution by giving a little to the workingmen; the city’s business owners thought the politicians had capitulated to the radicals and they resolved not to let this new state of affairs last.\nIn November, Olson would have to defend himself against the charge of abetting revolution, explaining that ‘Communists believe in the abolition of private property. We believe in its creation.’ He pulled out a narrow victory, returned to office mainly on account of votes from the workingmen of Minnesota.\nIt was so easy for Americans then and later to see the clash of classes as a struggle solely between groups of white people. One of the great novelists of the Great Depression, John Steinbeck, made his reputation by writing a novel, In Dubious Battle, based on a California strike—omitting the Mexicans and Mexican Americans who were, in real life, most of the workers.1 It was easier to sell books and inspire white people to sympathy for the poor, if the poor were not also people with darker skins. But race played a major role in shaping the Great Depression.\nAs one African American observed, black people in America were familiar with hard times long before the 1929 crash. ‘The Negro was born in depression. It didn’t mean too much to him, The Great American Depression, as you call it. There was no such thing. The best he could be is a janitor or shoeshine boy. It only became official when it hit the white man.’\nThe generation of African Americans who old in the Great Depression had been young in slavery. They could remember when the US government had promised them civil rights and, even better, they could remember when it had failed to deliver, allowing white supremacists to reassert control over first the South, and then much of the rest of the country.\nIndeed, by the middle of the 20th century, Minnesota, far in the north of the country and overwhelmingly white, was one of the few US states that did not have laws mandating racial segregation. As racial segregation spread across the South in the early 20th century, black Americans began to move north and west, to better opportunities and less racist cities like Minneapolis and Duluth, where a few hundred African Americans lived by the time of the Depression.\nIt was moving that gave the greatest hope to African Americans, moving out of the South to a part of the country where white folks’ prejudice, though vicious, did not altogether stop black citizens from staking a claim to their rights.\nIn the Depression, all kinds of people sought relief by moving. Maybe they had lost a job and a home or a farm and all went on the road together, a family living out of whatever excuse for an automobile they could find, like Steinbeck’s fictitious Joad clan headed from Oklahoma to California in The Grapes of Wrath. Maybe—more often—it was one man alone, leaving his family and relieving them of the burden his empty stomach imposed, hoping he would find work and be able to send a little money home. A woman and her children were more sympathetic, more deserving of charity, without a working-age man in the house.\nOften it was the crush of debt that caused families to split up or lose their homes this way; it happened all over the country through the Depression and more in 1934, as a drought set in on the plains. With ever-lower incomes, farmers couldn’t afford their mortgages. Bankers, deprived of their payments, seized homes and farms in a wave of foreclosures.\nIn 1934, owing to Minnesota, the highest court in the nation was deciding whether the government could do anything to relieve its citizens from this financial crush. Fearing a revolution from the state’s overburdened borrowers, Governor Olson declared that—for a while at least—no sheriff, constable or police officer of the state could carry out a bank’s order to foreclose. The legislature backed him up. As Olson said, he didn’t know if he had the legal authority to stop banks, even temporarily, from taking Minnesotans’ houses, but it was necessary for ‘preserving order within the boundaries of this state.’\nAsked to decide whether the state could thus step in to fend off the bankers, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes of the US Supreme Court ruled in 1934 that it might. Even though the right of private property was vital to the American tradition, the Chief Justice cited ‘a growing appreciation of public needs and of the necessity of finding ground for a rational compromise between individual rights and public welfare’ to let Minnesota lawmakers force a sense of mercy on the state’s creditors and permit a moratorium on foreclosures.\nEarthly mercy is never so eternal as the divine variety. Even with this relief from state and federal authorities, the Depression would continue to weigh on Americans of all kinds. The state could stave off debt, give you a job, afford relief, but the sum total of the reckoning one owed might still seem insurmountable. The suicide rate generally rises with unemployment, and it peaked in 1932. But even a couple of years onward it had not dropped to an ordinary level. Americans still had an uncertain hope in what this world could offer, and wavered between faith in their ability to save each other, and unbelief.\nEric Rauchway is Professor of History at the University of California, Davis. He’s written five books on US history and a novel."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Here are a couple charts showing wages in various forms of manufacturing, and then in various other forms of employment (including sugar growing) in Puerto Rico, for five data points: 1934, 1938, 1941, 1945, and 1949. The figures come from a hearing of the Special Investigating Subcommittee of the Committee on Education and Labor in the 81st Congress, held in 1949 and published in 1950, studying minimum wages and education in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.1 I came across the hearing in a study by the Virgin Islands economist Valdemar Hill Jr. on minimum wages in the Virgin Islands, which a librarian showed us during a visit to the Melvin Evans Library of the University of the Virgin Islands. So I did a set of small multiples for further thought.2\nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands came under the Fair Labor Standards Act minimum wage in 1938, which was 25 cents an hour, and then a year later became 30 cents. A June 1940 amendment (54 Stat. 615) put the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on a different basis, with lower rates allowed if established under industrial committees appointed by the wage administrator.3 Puerto Rico passed its own version of the Wagner Act, the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Act, in 1945, licensing collective bargaining and other protections for labor.4\nYou can see some trends in these data points, but I’m not sure I’m ready to draw firm conclusions, because of course there aren’t all the data points you’d want.\nSometimes you can see an upward trend in 1934–1938, sometimes not. But then of course the end of fiscal 1937–1938—when these wage measures are taken—was of course in the recession of that period. Sometimes you get an upward trend after the FLSA, 1938–1940; but also sometimes not. Often you get an upward trend 1940–1945, which makes sense, of course; there was a war on. And often you get a further upward trend after the PRLRA."

    "text": "Even though I am not old enough to have encountered the mid-century American Studies scholars when they were flourishing or in many cases, when they were even still alive, the books that brought me into my own career in US history belong to that tradition: American Humor, by Constance Rourke, or Love and Death in the American Novel, by Leslie Fiedler, say. This work is not necessarily right, per se, but it is certainly thought-provoking and inasmuch as that is the point of scholarship, good.1 In most cases it tells you things you didn’t already know and maybe more important it works by making connections which wouldn’t have occurred to a reader not as deeply steeped in the sources as the writer—which is essentially every reader.\nAndrew Hickey does the podcast, “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs,” which you have probably already had recommended to you but maybe not because it plainly belongs to that tradition, into which we could also throw Richard Hofstadter, David M. Potter, John Hope Franklin, and some of the other cast of characters from Nick Witham’s recent scholarship.\nHickey is an admirable cultural historian in part because he lets you know how he works:\nHe also revises himself in light of what he finds to be persuasive evidence:\nAnd he has wonderful, no-nonsense asides:\nThe podcast is a delight; I gather there is also now a book."

In that post I talked about William Appleman Williams, who is long dead. What about modern scholars?\nWell, let’s take a claim by Matthew Connelly: that Franklin D. Roosevelt deceived the American people in the run-up to the war. I’m not going to tackle all the elements of this claim in this post, just this one part about what Americans generally thought about the war.\n\nI do not know if there was any alternative to deceiving the American people, who largely opposed what they perceived to be a war of choice.\n\nConnelly’s claim here is similar to Robert Kagan’s; both believe the Roosevelt administration forced this “war of choice” on a reluctant American people for a greater good.\nHow much did the American people actually oppose US entry to the war, though?\nOver the course of 1941, polls frequently asked Americans “If you were asked to vote on the question of the United States entering the war against Germany and Italy [sometimes adding Japan], how would you vote—to go into the war, or to stay out of the war?”\nOn this question, opinion only very slightly shifts during the year in the direction of “go into the war.” Americans overwhelmingly answer they would vote to “stay out.”\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge: A graph showing support for going into the war in the middle 20 percent, and for staying out in the range of 70 percent. Data from Roper Center iPoll.\n\n\nIf that was all the information you had, you would say Americans overwhelmingly opposed US entry to the war.\nBut: over the same period, pollsters also often asked, “Which of these two things do you think is more important—that this country keep out of war, or that Germany be defeated, even at the risk of our getting into the war?”\nOn this question, Americans quite consistently answered they thought Germany needed to be defeated, even at the risk of US entry to the war. There’s not really that much of a shift.\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge: A graph showing support for the defeat of Germany, even at the risk of war, running in the range of 65 percent, as against the US keeping out running in the range of 30-ish percentage points.\n\n\nSo considering this second result, it looks like Americans were broadly in favor of the US doing what it could to ensure German defeat, even—explicitly—at the risk of the US getting into the war. In other words, respondents favored what was pretty much the Roosevelt administration’s policy.\nYou can if you like add one question asked at the start of November 1941: “If our present leaders and military advisors say that the only way to defeat Germany is for this country to go into the war, would you be in favor of this country’s going into the war against Germany?” To that, 70 percent of respondents said “yes,” as against only 24 percent “no” and 6 percent “no opinion.” It appears, then, that respondents were willing to go along with the Roosevelt administration’s judgment about the necessity of US entry to war to defeat Germany."

    "title": "AHA Congressional Briefing: History of Tariffs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The AHA hosted a Congressional briefing this morning in the Rayburn office building with about 70 people in attendance and a panel including Douglas Irwin, Sharon Ann Murphy, and me. C-SPAN filmed it for later broadcast. My remarks as prepared appear below, though if you should someday watch the C-SPAN recording you’ll know I went off script, based on what Doug had already said.\nGood morning. I’m going to speak for a few minutes on the origins of presidential authority to make tariff deals with other countries in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.\nFranklin Roosevelt first ran for president in 1932 arguing for lower tariffs as part of the New Deal by saying the “outrageously excessive [tariff] rates . . . must come down. . . . by consenting to reduce . . . some of our duties in order to secure a lowering of foreign tariff walls.”1 The idea was to reduce tariffs in exchange for other countries’ doing likewise, so as to open overseas markets for US goods. This is the trade principle known as reciprocity. Opinion polls demonstrate that Roosevelt supporters expected him to reduce tariffs.2 Herbert Hoover vigorously opposed reducing tariffs and warned that if it happened, “The grass will grow in [the] streets of a hundred cities, a thousand towns.”3 Roosevelt won the election and the right to reduce tariffs; his inaugural parade included a group of men with lawnmowers marching through the streets of Washington, DC.4 Once in office, he acquired the power to negotiate lower tariffs on a reciprocal basis.\nTo fulfill Roosevelt’s campaign promise, the Reciprocal Tariff Agreement Act of 1934 amended the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to allow the president to make trade agreements with foreign countries “so that foreign markets will be made available.” The law aimed at “increasing the purchasing power of the American public” and “restoring the American standard of living.”5 It enacted the idea of reciprocity; the US and another country would each agree to lower rates to improve trade between the two. It incorporated an idea of gradualism—in no case could the reduction in rate be more than fifty percent of the Smoot-Hawley rate.6 And although it described bilateral agreements, when those agreements included most-favored-nation clauses—which was language ensuring that any nation signing an agreement would gain any advantage later secured by any other nation signing an agreement—the Roosevelt administration acquired the means to gradually liberalize trade with many parties.7 Within three years the administration negotiated sixteen agreements and more would soon follow, increasing trade among participating countries.8\nI want to focus now on the mechanism for reducing tariffs, and for reducing them gradually, which was as important as the general aim of lower tariffs.\nLet me talk first about gradualism. Roosevelt appreciated the need for a gentle shift away from protectionism. As he said privately, protectionism might be “all right today” but he opposed it “as a long-term policy,” saying, “in the long run it would work against us and our world trade and our industry.”9 He had similar views about monetary policy; he wanted to devalue the dollar gradually.10 In both cases he knew he wanted to make an ultimately dramatic change in the cost of doing business but he wanted to make it without too much disruption to business plans then in effect. So gradualism was the order of the day.\nSecond, as to the mechanism: the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act delegated tariff power to the president, who would strike deals with other countries. The point of delegating this power to the president was to lower tariffs. By 1934 it was clear Congress had great difficulty doing so.11\nWhen Congress made tariffs, as both William McKinley and Herbert Hoover found to their disappointment, lawmaking quickly became an exercise in log-rolling—you vote for a tariff increase protecting industry in my district; I’ll vote for a tariff increase protecting industry in your district. Log-rolling tended generally to produce higher rates, as every lawmaker looked to get protection for his district. The tariff became a mechanism for providing constituent service and patronage—a domestic, rather than an international, policy, even though it worked by affecting international trade.\nBy the time of Smoot-Hawley, protectionist lawmakers described log-rolling not as an unfortunate side effect but as an essential feature of tariff-making. As Reed Smoot said, “the tariff is a domestic matter, and an American tariff must be framed and put into force by the American Congress and administration. No foreign country has a right to interfere.”12\nThe reciprocal mechanism begun in 1934 let the president reach agreements with foreign countries—much against what Smoot said—and let him do so in broad consultation with various experts throughout the executive branch.\nThe handout has an organization chart of the trade agreements mechanism set up under the Roosevelt administration.13 As you can see, there are some state department committees, and many more interdepartmental committees—including representatives from commerce, agriculture, treasury, and so on.\nThis broad range of committees served not only to get input from a variety of sources—thus ensuring everyone got heard—but also to diffuse, and actually to obscure, the process by which a decision got made. A politician or business representative might look at this chart and say to himself, well, this is a nightmare; I don’t know who to lobby—and that’s exactly the point. There were lots of people you could talk to but shy of the president himself, you didn’t know who’s making decisions. And even if you did have access to the president, having this elaborate mechanism allowed the president to say, well, you know, I have multiple, carefully composed expert recommendations; I can’t very well go against them.14 So these economic experts could toil away, untroubled by influence, and recommend action to the president. John Maynard Keynes famously hoped that economics would one day become as dull as dentistry; he meant this as a compliment to his future profession—that it would become boringly professional, rather than heated and political.15 The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (like, as it happens, much of the New Deal) embodied this view.\nThis emphasis on gradual movement, international agreement, and a mechanism centered in the executive but informed by an array of expert advisors had the intended effect of reaching generally lower tariffs and increasing world trade. By the end of the Roosevelt administration in 1945, twenty-eight agreements were in place and the fifty percent limit in rate reductions had been nearly reached. Congress then extended the authority and allowed another fifty percent reduction.16\nHaving the president make international agreements shielded legislators from having to vote for a tariff reduction. And it allowed them to reap the benefits of increased exports from their district. It allowed lower rates and increased global trade. Moreover, the real and widespread benefits to the US economy of increased exports helped forge a bipartisan consensus on free trade.17"

Click to enlarge.\n\n\nHicks, according to Hunt anyway, cordially loathes the collection of which he is curator, which perhaps accounts for the ambivalence on some of the explanatory plaques, like the one for that Haida totem, which asserts its figures and stories remain “part of Haida culture.”\nAs it happens a couple weeks ago Kathy Olmsted and I were on a research trip, mainly to go to archives, but also to see some other Haida, and Tlingit and Tsimshian, totem poles together with a clan house not unlike Star House, in Saxman Village near Ketchikan, Alaska. Together with Totem Bight, also near Ketchikan, and some other totem poles in town, these sites are the legacy of a New Deal program to, as one of its creators wrote, “see that these totems are preserved in situ.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotems and clan house at Saxman Village.

Click to enlarge.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the New Deal, the federal government hired Native carvers to practice and pass on their art, which had fallen out of favor under missionary influence. The explanatory plaques there, unlike the one in the Pitt Rivers, do not assert that the totem poles and their figures and stories remain part of Native culture but perhaps that is because it is obvious; there Native people retain stewardship of the living art.\nIt is of course true that the Roosevelt reform program in the territories constituted an empire of the New Deal. Does it matter that this empire, instead of carting cultural artifacts away to the Pitt Rivers, funded the preservation and perpetuation of the artifacts and moreover the art form amongst the people to whom it belonged?"

All these places came under Axis attack during the war.1 US citizens on Howland Island were killed by Japanese attack. There are of course excellent cases that these lands and people ought not to have been under US government, but they were; and I suppose the morality or legality of US sovereignty over them, however dubious, would not have been notably improved by leaving them to the mercy of the Axis powers."

    "text": "On April 7, 1932, while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a radio speech laying out “a few essentials, a beginning, in fact, of a planned program” of economic recovery; what you might call the basic concepts of a plan.\nFirst, he said, the plan needed to run “bottom to top and not from top to bottom”—in contrast to the recently created Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which put some billions of dollars “at the disposal of the big banks, the railroads and the corporations of the nation.”\nHe said that even a large emergency public works program “would be only a stopgap,” and said that really what the nation needed was a “cure.”\nHe then sketched three basic ideas: pushing up the prices of farm commodities “to restore purchasing power to the farming half of the country”; protection for homeowners from foreclosure by protecting the smaller banks and lending companies; lowering tariffs “on the basis of a reciprocal exchange” with other countries.\nHe said these would be “only a part of ten or a dozen vital factors.” But that “temporary relief from the top down” would not suffice; the nation needed “permanent relief from the bottom up.”1\nThe New York Times editorial board were shocked at this “demagogic claptrap.” The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was “conceived by the best financial and business brains of this country.” As for the smaller banks, “the closing of these little local banks has been stayed and almost stopped.” It had not, of course, been stopped on what the governor would have called a “permanent” basis and would resume and accelerate later in the summer.2\nRoosevelt enjoyed “the howl from the New York Times and other leading papers,”3 as he wrote to Josephus Daniels, who had been his boss in the Navy Department. For his part, Daniels said, “you hit the bullseye”:\nRoosevelt would come to emphasize a large program of public works more, later in the campaign; at one point he would say that his proposed reforestation program alone—the idea that became the Civilian Conservation Corps—might employ a million workers.5 And he would continue to campaign on the ideas of propping up farm prices, lowering tariffs, and protecting the smaller lenders and borrowers."
