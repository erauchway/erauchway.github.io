A blog containing historical pedantry about the period of the Roosevelt presidency, 1933--1945. I do know that "necessitous" means "needy" and not "needful"; my thought is that this blog is lacking in one of the necessaries for a blog, that is, a blogosphere. Nonetheless, contrary to Roosevelt's occasional remark, this necessitous blog *is* a free (as in beer) blog.
