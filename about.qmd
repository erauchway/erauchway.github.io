A blog containing historical pedantry about the period of the Roosevelt presidency, 1933--1945. Honestly this is mostly research notes, with a focus on primary sources I've come across and have something to say about. I don't want to do current-events blogging. I might eventually throw in a photograph or two. No promises.

I do know that "necessitous" means "needy" and not "needful"; my thought is that this blog is lacking in one of the necessaries for a blog, that is, a robust history blogosphere. Nonetheless, contrary to Roosevelt's occasional remark, this necessitous blog *is* a free (as in beer) blog.

My c.v. is [here,](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/erauchway/cv_pub/blob/main/rauchway_cv.html) if you want it.
